I tried contacting them via telephone and left a message as well as email, I failed to hear back from them in a timely manner so I reached out to them again and got ahold of them. I simply wanted my contacts switched back to Acuvue and they tried to tell me that it was allergies causing my problems and were insisiting on me keeping Air Optix. Eventually I did get them to agree to switch my contacts back to acuvue. \n\nIn march I had another eye irritation and I went to Vanderbilt Eye Institue, they told me it was a continued reaction to the Air Optix lenses because I did not give my eyes enough time to heal before applying my new contacts - which was I was not educated on by Music City Optical when I got my new set of contacts. I then reviewed them on facebook at that time. \n\nToday (8/30/16) I recieved a response to my review on facebook and a corresponding email stating that I was being slanderous and lying, which was not the case at all. I was simply explaining my experience with Music City Optical.",

When trying to call about my problem no one answered for 2 full business days. Then when talking with another very unhelpful employee, she told me that unit was already gone & suggested other units more expensive & not in the move in date discussed. When asking if they would honor the price originally discussed in email correspondence, they would not. Long story shorter, I cancelled my application & just wasted $50.
