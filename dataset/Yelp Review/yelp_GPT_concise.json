The Bloody Mary was flavorful and reasonably priced, and the wait time was manageable with the convenient text message system. Although the servers were a bit forgetful, the overall experience was still enjoyable. The turtle soup was outstanding, and the generous portion of pork chop with red beans left me satisfied until bedtime. The historic location and ambiance added to the dining experience, making it worth a visit when in the Quarter.",
