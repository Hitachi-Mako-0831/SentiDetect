        "Text": "The Federal Communications Commission has tentatively decided not impose fees on Internet service providers for use of local telephone lines, an official said Thursday.\nOn Tuesday, the commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking setting out two possible plans for reducing the $23 billion a year that long-distance telephone companies pay to local service providers in access fees.\n\"The commission raised the specific question of whether ISPs (Internet service providers) should pay access charges as we currently understand them,\" Kevin Werbach, counsel for new technology at the commission said. The FCC \"tentatively concluded that the answer is no.\"\nLocal phone companies had pressed to have the access fee applied to Internet service companies. The phone companies argued that consumers using the Internet were getting a free ride and tying up local lines with lengthy calls.\nInternet companies countered that such fees would smother the growth of the booming online industry.\n\"We think they did exactly the right thing,\" said Jill Lesser, deputy director of law and public policy at America Online, the largest online service in the world. \"It means the FCC is thinking in the right way about this. They're thinking for the growth of the Internet.\"\nThe commission did issue a \"notice of inquiry\" asking for comments on the issues involved, Werbach said.\nThe arguments of both sides raise \"legitimate issues, so the commission initiated the notice of inquiry to develop a record on that,\" he said.\nA notice of inquiry seeks comment but does not give the commission authority to then adopt a rule. The commission would have to first issue a notice of proposed rulemaking before applying access fees to Internet service providers, Werbach said.\nThe Internet notice is \"more foward looking\" than the proposed rules for long distance access fees, Werbach said. \"Once we have an idea what replaces the access charge system then we can take a look at that,\" he said.",

        "Text": "Legislators introduced two bills Thursday to overturn the Clinton administration's export limits on computer encryption technology, a key component of online commerce and global communications.\nEncryption products, which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software \"key,\" were once the realm of spies and generals.\nBut with the booming growth of the Internet, secret coding is now used for everything from keeping a business's e-mail confidential to protecting a consumer's credit card number if it is transmitted online.\nSenators said export restrictions on encryption products were hindering the development of the Internet and making it impossible for U.S. companies to compete with foreign firms.\nThe bills \"roll back current restrictions on the export of strong cryptography so that high-tech U.S. firms are free to compete in the global marketplace and meet the demand of customers,\" Sen. Pat Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and co-sponsor of both bills, said at a Capitol Hill news conference.\n\"Online commerce will never reach its full potential under the policies of this and past administrations,\" said Sen. Conrad Burns, a Montana Republican , also a co-sponsor.\nThe bills would generally allow a U.S. company to export a product with strong encryption features if similiar products were being offered for sale by a foreign supplier. Leahy and Burns introduced similiar measures in the last Congress.\nUnder the current Clinton administration policy, a company may export strong encryption only if the product also includes a feature to allow the U.S. government to crack the code by recovering the software \"key\" when acting under a court order or similiar authority. The administration says it must be able to crack the codes to catch international criminals and terrorists.\nIf the bills became law, mandatory key recovery would be banned but the government would still be permitted to restrict the export of encryption for military use or to countries posing terrorist threats.\nThe legislation would also write into law the current policy permitting unrestricted domestic use of encryption -- but one bill would criminalize the use of codes to obstruct justice.\nThe Clinton administration signalled its displeasure with the new bills.\n\"We continue to be disappointed with Senator Burns' approach because it does not balance the needs of individual privacy and economic growth with national security and public safety,\" Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch said. \"We believe there is a market for key recovery products from businesses who recognise the need for a back door to their own corporate data.\"\nComputer companies and privacy advocates hailed the bills.\n\"Both bills promote the freedom of this nation's fastest-growing industry to provide customers here and abroad with products they demand,\" said Robert Holleyman, president of the Business Software Alliance. The group includes Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus Development and Apple Computer Inc., among others.\n\"This is the most important privacy legislation before the Congress today,\" said Jerry Berman, executive director of the Centre for Democracy and Technology.\nBerman, who strongly opposes mandatory key recovery, said the policy ought to be \"my lock, my key.\"",

Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig said his office will begin approving bank affiliates moving into an assortment of non-banking businesses.\nBoth the Fed's proposal and the Comptroller's actions will raise the pressure on Congress to scrap the Glass-Steagall Act, according to Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institute.  \nIn the past, banks led the charge to change the law because they wanted to get into other businesses, like selling insurance or underwriting stock deals. Insurance companies and securities firms generally opposed the banks creating legislative gridlock.\n\"Now the tables have been turned,\" Litan said. \"But it's not a two-way street. Other industries will want to level the playing field.\"  \nBoth moves also reflect current market realities. The financial services industry, from banks to insurance companies to mutual funds, is converging. Mutual funds already offer checking account-like money market funds and some of the leading stock and bond underwriters are commercial banks.\nIn the words of one top regulator, the Fed's move from 10 to 25 percent, \"is not material.\" The Fed has required banks to take certain steps to prevent problems in the subsidiaries from affecting the bank itself, and its government-insured deposits.\nCompetitors in other fields fret that the banks insured deposits are a form of government subsidy giving the banks an unfair advantage when they venture into other fields.\nComptroller Ludwig disagreed. Speaking to reporters after delivering a speech here Thursday, Ludwig said that walling off the subsidiary \"basically eliminates any subsidization.\"\nHe opposes efforts by some in Congress to keep banks out of certain fields, such as real estate or merchant banking, entirely. \"It's a mistake to set product limits, particularly in this day and age when we have such a dynamic marketplace,\" he said.",

        "Text": "The Supreme Court said Monday it would decide whether a federal regulator had properly allowed credit unions to expand their membership over the past 15 years, settling a long-running legal dispute between the cooperative non-profits and banks.\nCredit unions praised the court's action to reconsider an Appellate court decision last July in favour of the banks. But bank representatives said the court was only delaying the inevitable.\nThe 1934 Federal Credit Union Act creating credit unions \"was not meant to delineate and protect bank markets at the expense of the consumer,\" said Marc Schaefer, president of AT&T Family Federal Credit Union, the credit union being sued by banks in the case.\n\"Consumers everywhere will be the winners when banks compete in the marketplace instead of the courts and on Capitol Hill,\" Schaeffer added.\nAmerican Bankers Association executive vice president Donald Ogilvie countered that \"the facts and law weigh overwhelmingly in our favour.\"\n\"We are disappointed at the prospect of delay in the enfocement of a law we believe is quite clear,\" he said.\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case in its upcoming term, which begins in October. A decision is likely early next year.\nThe case affects about 3,600 federal credit unions serving 32 million customers, Justice Department lawyer Walter Dellinger said.\nThe appeals court ruling in favour of the banks \"threatens nationwide instability and losses in the credit union industry affecting millions of persons,\" Dellinger said.\nUntil 1982, credit unions were limited to having members with a single common bond, such as people who worked for the same employer or lived in the same neighbourhood. Owned by their members, non-profit credit unions paid no federal taxes and were able to offer bank-like services often at lower prices than banks.\nBut in 1982, concerned about a lack of diversification, the National Credit Union Administration decided to allow credit unions to accept members from multiple distinct groups.\nAs many previously tiny credit unions diversified and grew substantially larger, banks complained of unfair competition. In 1990, they sued AT&T Family Federal, a North Carolina union that had grown to encompass over 150 different groups.\nAfter the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia struck down the 1982 policy change last July, a lower court imposed strict membership limits on multi-group credit unions.\nThose limits have since been put on hold until the Supreme Court makes a decision. But if the banks win, their next move could be to ask the courts to force multi-group credit unions to throw out members from all but one group.\nCredit unions said they will ask Congress to amend the law if they lose in the Supreme Court.\n\"Congress never intended the 1934 Federal Credit Union Act to limit credit union growth or to protect banks from competition,\" said Daniel Mica, president of Credit Union National Association, a leading trade group. \"If the court does not see it this way, we think Congress will recognise consumers' need for credit unions.\"",

        "Text": "The growing mass of Internet users have paid their fair share to local telephone companies and pose little threat to the phone system, according to a study released on Wednesday by a coalition of Internet and computer companies.\nThe coalition presented the report to counter studies by local phone companies released last year seeking to justify new access fees on Internet usage. The phone company studies found that Internet usage threatened to overwhelm the system.  \n\"The Internet is not crashing the telephone network,\" Information Technology Association of America President Harris Miller said at a news conference here.\n\"We are bringing the real facts to bear on a 'problem' that the phone companies have anecdotally created to protect their own interests,\" said Miller, whose group is a member of the Internet Access Coalition.\nOn December 24, the Federal Communications Commission said it had tentatively decided not to impose access fees on Internet providers similiar to those paid by long distance companies to local phone companies.  \nBut the commission also asked for comments about the effect of the Internet on the phone system.\n\"Our findings clearly show that claims of phone network 'congestion' resulting from Internet traffic and predictions of a 'meltdown' are greatly exaggerated,\" said Lee Selwyn, one of the study's authors.\nFurther, ordinary consumers using the Internet already pay the phone companies more than enough to cover the cost of increased use, said Selwyn, who is an expert on telecommunications regulation.  \nThe study found, for example, that in 1995 consumers paid more than $1.4 billion for installation and use of six million second phone lines devoted to accessing the Internet or other online services. The study said another eight million second lines were not primarily used for Internet access.\nLocal phone companies, some of which had not yet seen the new study, disputed Selwyn's conclusions.\"To suggest that there is no real problem here is mind-boggling,\" Bell Atlantic spokesman Harry Mitchell said. As Internet companies add huge numbers of phone lines to meet growing demand, \"it does impact the capacity of the public telephone network.\"  \nAmerica Online, for example, said recently it would double the number of modems it has to connect with subscribers from 200,000 to 400,000 by June.\nBut phone company studies considered only a few pieces of the phone system, focusing on switches between Internet service providers and the rest of the network, Selwyn said. While those few switches might be congested, capacity could be added inexpensively, he said.\nThe study also cited speeches by some phone company executives who have bragged about the additional revenues generated by increased Internet usage.  \n\"Sales of secondary lines at Bell Atlantic increased more than 50 percent, fueled by surging demand for Internet and telecommuting applications,\" company CEO Raymond Smith told Wall Street analysts last March. The revenue generated substantial profit because \"we were able to provision new lines and services from idle capacity in an existing plant.\"\nCompany spokesman Mitchell said charges from second lines \"were not designed to subsidize Internet service providers.\"\nHowever, all sides agree that a technological solution could eliminate most congestion problems by separating calls carrying voice and data.\nSBC Communications, parent of Southwestern Bell, announced last week it would introduce such splitting technology at a cost of less than $100 million.\n\"Technological solutions are readily available,\" Paul Misener, chairman of the Internet coalition's steering committee said.",

Exports of such products totalled $40 billion in 1995, the draft report noted.\nThe idea is to hitch U.S. exports to the speeding Internet commerce train. Sales of goods and services online are projected to grow to $7 billion in the year 2000, from about $1 billion this year, according to market researchers at Jupiter Communications.\n\"Companies have told us there would be a tremendous potential to increase world trade across the Internet if we could provide the right kind of environment,\" Magaziner said.\nThe draft report, called \"A Framework for Global Electronic Commerce,\" covers nine issues, from taxation and customs to privacy and security.\nOn taxation, the draft report echoes a report issued by the Treasury Department last month by stating no new taxes should be imposed. Acting through the World Trade Organisation, the United States should push for the Internet to be designated a duty-free zone, the draft said.\nSome consumers worry that their privacy will be violated when they shop online. The report said governments should push vendors to disclose what will be done with information about consumers rather than dictate to merchants what they can or cannot do with the data.\nOn some issues, such as encryption -- encoding information in a scrambled format to provide a measure of security or privacy -- existing administration policies may be seen as conflicting with the free market approach of the draft report.\nMagaziner said policies will evolve over time, \"but the paper will reflect where we are now.\"\nMagaziner headed Clinton's failed effort to reform the U.S. health care system, an initiative critics said favoured government over the private sector.\nWhile disagreeing with his critics' characterisation of the health care plan, Magaziner said the Internet \"is a wholly different animal.\n\"I'm a problem solver, not an ideologue,\" he said.",

Under the Clinton policy, domestic use of encryption is not regulated but the strongest coding products cannot be exported unless they include key recovery.\nThe draft guidelines, approved by a group of government and private sector experts at a meeting at the end of January, still must be approved by the top-level OECD council.  \nThe council is composed of ambassadors from the 29 member countries.\nU.S. companies that have opposed the Clinton policy, contending it stifles their ability to compete with unfettered foreign firms, drew little solace from the OECD draft.\n\"This is not helpful,\" Netscape Communications Corp's public policy counsel Peter Harter said.

But with the explosion of online commerce on the Internet, encryption has become a vital tool for protecting everything from a business' e-mail message to a consumer's credit card number sent over the Net.\nThe amount of protection afforded by encryption is largely a function of the length of the software key measured in bits, the smallest unit of computer data.\nCompanies said products with just 40-bit long keys, the old limit, were too easy to crack. The approvals came just days after Ian Goldberg, a graduate student at the University of California, cracked a message encoded with a sofware key 40-bits long.\nThe government did not name the companies on Friday given permission to export stronger, 56-bit programmes, but Glenwood, Maryland-based Trusted Information Systems acknowledged that it was one of the three.\n\"Recent attacks on 40-bit encryption have shown that a global move to at least 56-bit (U.S. government standard) security must come soon,\" Trusted Information Executive Vice President Steven Lipner said.",

But sophisticated investors such as big banks have been allowed to trade similiar financial instruments with little direct regulation, market participants said.\nThat distinction has been blurred in recent years, as defendants accused of fraud by the CFTC have sought to rely on an exemption from regulation, relied on by the bigger players, in a 1974 amendment to the Commodity Exchange Act.\nThe amendment was added at the request of the Treasury Department to ensure that sophisticated investors trading in foreign currency and a few other markets would not be subject to uneccessary regulation by the CFTC.\nLower courts have made conflicting rulings about the 1974 amendment and the Supreme Court decided last year to hear the case of William Dunn, a foreign currency investment advisor charged with fraud by the CFTC after losing $95 million of his clients' money.\nJeffrey Minear, assistant to the Solicitor General -- the federal government's representative before the Supreme Court -- defended the CFTC's prosecution of Dunn before the court Wednesday. Minear argued that the 1974 exemption for \"transactions in foreign currency\" did not cover Dunn's trading in foreign currency options, one type of derivative. A derivative is an investment whose value is derived from a stock, bond, currency, commodity or other instrument.\nBut justices questioned Minear's distinction, which relied heavily on the particular meaning of the word \"in.\"\nCongress was \"not using consistent language\" in the commodity laws passed in 1974 and since then, Justice Antonin Scalia said. \"They use in, they use on, they use involving.\"\nMinear drew a sharp rebuke from Chief Justice William Rehnquist when he later argued that Congress expressed greater concern about fraudulent use of options than other types of investments under a 1922 commodity trading law.\n\"Perhaps it was true in 1922 but that doesn't prove it's true now,\" the chief justice interjected.\nGary Stumpp, Dunn's lawyer, argued that other federal agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission might have jurisdiction over fraudulent foreign exchange trading but not the CFTC.\nSeveral Wall Street trade groups and big banks filed friend-of-the-court briefs in support of Dunn's position. They warned that if the court upheld the CFTC's position, the burden of additional regulation might drive the gigantic $40 billion a day foreign exchange market in the United States might overseas.\nOn the other side, Chicago futures exchanges said they could be put out of business by unregulated competitors if the court throws out the CFTC's case against Dunn.\nBrooksley Born, chairwoman of the CFTC, attended the argument but declined to comment afterwards.\nA decision is not expected for at least a few months. Several members of Congress have said they may introduce legislation early next year to change the 1974 amendment, possibly rendering the verdict in the Dunn case moot.",

By law, such trading must occur on a recogized exchange, such as the Chicago Board of Trade or the New York Mercantile Exchange.\nBut when Congress created the commission in 1974, it added an amendment permitting off-exchange trading in foreign currency and a few other items without CFTC regulation. The amendment was requested by the Treasury Department, which believed that the developing market in foreign currency among large banks and securities firms would be overregulated by CFTC oversight.\nThe CFTC stayed away from the inter-bank foreign exchange market, which has grown to $40 billion a day in total trading. The commission did, however, prosecute small-scale fraudulent foreign exchange investment peddlers, often called \"bucket shops.\"\nBut when the CFTC pursued William Dunn, whose $180 million foreign currency fund lost $95 million in 1993, Dunn argued that the 1974 Treasury amendment should also apply to his trading of foreign exchange options.\nOn Tuesday, the Supreme Court agreed with the bulk of Dunn's argument.\n\"We think it plain that foreign currency options are 'transactions in foreign currency' within the plain meaning of the statute,\" Justice John Paul Stevens wrote. \"We are not persuaded by any of the arguments advanced by the CFTC in support of a narrower reading.\"\nThat pleased banks and Wall Street trade groups, which had sided with Dunn. They argued that subjecting their off-exchange foreign exchange trading to CFTC oversight would be too costly, forcing them to shut down U.S. operations and move overseas.\n\"We're obviously delighted at the result,\" said Ken Raisler, an attorney for several of the trade groups.\n\"It supports our view that the amendment should be read broadly,\" Raisler, a former general counsel of the CFTC added.\nDunn's lawyer and the banks suggested that any wrongdoing in the foreign exchange area could be dealt with under existing law by other federal agencies, but the Supreme Court did not address the issue. Most off-exchange derivatives trading is not directly regulated, although most participants in such markets are overseen by bank, securities and insurance regulators.\nThe CFTC still has jurisdiction over foreign currency derivatives traded on an exchange, which include futures contracts. But that market is dwarfed by the over-the-counter market among banks and similiar institutions.\nIn a lower court case last year, the CFTC argued unsuccessfully that a fraudulent \"bucket shop\" constituted an exchange.\nOn Tuesday, the commission maintained that the Supreme Court had decided only the narrow issue of whether the Treasury amendment covered options trading.\n\"While we are disappointed in the outcome of the case, we note that the Supreme Court's opinion was limited to the narrow issue of whether the Treasury amendment treats futures and options the same,\" CFTC general counsel Dan Waldman said. \"The court's decision does not affect the commission's ongoing efforts to police fraud against the public in foreign currency trading.\"\nCongress is already discussing amending the 1974 Treasury amendment. The Supreme Court's decision \"underlines the need for Congress to make decisions about what financial products should or should not be subject to the CFTC's jurisdiction,\" said Andy Fisher, spokesman for the Senate Agriculture Committee.\nSens. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., Pat Leahy, D-Vt., and Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, introduced a Senate bill to overhaul futures regulation. \"It makes the case to proceed with that bill as quickly as we can,\" Fisher said.\nThe court invited congressional action. Recognising an \"important public policy dispute\" underlying the case, the court suggested \"these arguments are addressed to the Congress, not the courts.\"",

Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, urged the legislators to impose new laws protecting Hollywood products.\n\"Congress cannot avoid that all intellectual property has to be protected -- this can't be Dodge City without a sheriff,\" Valenti said. But he also praised the Internet as \"the most valuable and spacious information greenhouse that's ever been built.\"\nPSINet's Schrader countered that existing laws already protected movies, books and other works. \"Everything is not new,\" he said. \"It's the same-old, same-old.\"",

        "Text": "U.S. laws governing the trillion dollar futures markets could be rocked by the Supreme Court's interpretation of the word \"in\" in a case to be argued Wednesday. But a legislative solution is in the offing.\nAt issue is a 1974 amendment to the Commodity Exchange Act, the primary law regulating trading of futures contracts on everything from wheat and corn to interest rates and electricity.  \nFutures exchanges say a broad reading of the amendment would put them out of business, while major banks argue a narrow reading would force them to move vast operations out of the United States.\nWhatever the outcome, Congressional action is expected next year. \"It's certainly significant, but I suspect that at the end of the day, legislation will overtake this,\" said Howard Schneider, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission general counsel.  \nWhen Congress expanded the commodity act in 1974 to cover futures on non-agricultural commodities and created the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to police the markets, some big banks objected.\nThey argued the law should not apply to trading of foreign currency, government securities and similiar items already flourishing among banks and securities firms.\nThe Treasury Department agreed and in a letter to Congress suggested an amendment to the law that became known as the Treasury Amendment.  \nThe amendment says \"transactions in\" foreign currency, security warrants, repurchase options, government securities and a few other items are exempt from the Commodity Exchange Act unless they involve sale for future delivery conducted \"on a board of trade.\"\nThe banks continued to trade foreign currencies unimpeded but the CFTC began to encounter a new problem. Unscrupulous \"bucket shops\" that peddled off-exchange commodity contracts to rip off unsuspecting investors were expanding into foreign currency schemes.  \nThe CFTC shut down the forex shops but lawyers for the shops argued forex investment contracts should be considered transactions \"in\" foreign currency and exempt from CFTC rules.\nLower federal courts took up the issue but reached conflicting conclusions. Some said \"transactions in foreign currency\" exempted dealings only with actual currencies, not derivatives on the currencies like futures and options. Others decided that \"in\" exempted all trading involving currencies.\nThe Supreme Court will likely resolve that conflict in Wednesday's case concerning William Dunn, the manager of a $180 million hedge fund investing in foreign currencies.  \nIn November, 1993, Dunn told his investors he had lost $95 million. The CFTC soon charged Dunn with fraud under the Commodity Exchange Act. A lower court agreed.\nAsking the Supreme Court to uphold that decision, CFTC lawyers argue that Congress would have used the word \"involving\" rather than \"in\" if it had wanted to exempt forex derivatives.\nBut Dunn's lawyers and four banks that dealt with his fund maintain that the CFTC has no jurisdiction to prosecute under the commodity act.  \nAffirming the earlier decision would undermine the $40 billion a day global currency market by subjecting it to unworkable regulation, the banks said. And Dunn, if guilty of any misconduct, could be prosecuted under wire fraud or securities laws, the banks said.\nAt the other extreme, the Chicago futures exchanges appear terrified the court will strike down the lower court ruling.  \nChicago Board of Trade, in an amicus brief written in part by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation, warned that a broad reading of the exemption would create havoc, allowing unregulated dealings in all kinds of futures contracts now traded on exchanges.\n\"The idea that someone could clone the Board of Trade's principal products, trade them off-exchange and not be subject to any regulation is pretty darn troublesome,\" Mark Young, another exchange attorney, said.\nA ruling is not expected for months, but the banks and exchanges will have to continue their struggle in the legislative venue almost immediately.\nCongress could resolve the dispute through legislation, which would render the decision moot. One bill was introduced in the last Congress to amend the Treasury Amendment and Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN) has said he will likely offer a new bill early next year.",

But the Manchester United midfielder failed to control the ball, wasting what would turn out be one of the game's few good scoring chances.\nNext it was the Czechs turn to falter. Newcastle United goalkeeper Pavel Srnicek, making his first cap in over a year, tried to clear the ball, but hit attacker Alfonso Perez and watched helplessly as it rolled just wide of the net.\nThe Czechs picked up their play in the second half, putting Spain on its heels for the rest of the game.\nBut veteran Valencia goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta held his ground on Pavel Kuka's dangerous turnaround blast from just outside the penalty spot, and then robbed Jan Suchoparek in the dying minutes of the game, stopping the midfielder's drive from three metres away to keep the game scoreless.\n\"I don't think we lost points tonight because they are such an excellent team. They played strongly in the backfield and its too bad we missed out on the two great chances we had,\" said Liverpool sensation Patrik Berger.\nAdded Spanish coach :\"Raul played very well and I'm pleased with our team. Both teams could have one this match, and I'm content with the result though we would have liked to have taken three points.\"\nTeams:\nCzech Republic - 1-Pavel Srnicek, 2-Radoslav Latal, 3-Jan Suchoparek, 4-Pavel Nedved (15-Martin Frydek, 86th), 5-Miroslav Kadlec, 6-Michal Hornak, 7-Jiri Nemec, 8-Karel Poborsky (17-Vladimir Smicer, 58th), 9-Pavel Kuka, 10-Patrik Berger, 11-Radek Bejbl\nSpain - 1-Andoni Zubizarreta, 2-Abelardo Fernandez, 3-Sergi Barjuan, 4-Rafael Alkorta, 5-Miguel Angel Nadal, 6-Fernando Hierro, 7-Raul Gonzalez, 8-Luis Enrique Martinez, 9-Guillermo Amor (18-Ismael Urzaiz, 76th), 10-Julen Guerrero (14-Josep Guardiola, 52nd), 11-Alfonso Perez (15-Roberto Rios, 73rd)",

The situation is not as rosy as it may appear from the numbers of ODS candidates that are moving into the next round.\"\nWith three of the 81 constitunecies officially declared, the striking statistic was the turnout figure which ranged from 26.36 percent in the northern mining town of Most to 29.78 in one constituency in the industrial city of Ostrava.\nOne official of the Central Electoral Commission, Ales Kaspar, forecast that turnout nationwide would be by far the lowest in the four parliamentary elections held since the 1989 fall of communism. \"According to optimistic expectations, the turnout could be between 30 and 40 percent,\" he told Reuters.\nThis suggested the real winners might not be ODS or the opposition Social Democrats, but the far-right Republicans who boycotted the Senate polls and told Czechs to follow suit.\nOpposition Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman bewailed Czechs' apathy towards the upper house, but predicted turnout would improve in the second round on November 22-23.\n\"I would like to remind all voters who criticise our country that by not voting they do not have the right to criticise the government. They have only the right to criticise themselves,\" said Zeman, who is speaker of the lower house.\nBut he added: \"I firmly believe that in the second round, participation will be markedly higher because then it is a choice between the two strongest candidates,\" he said.\nShare dealers welcomed signs that ODS, which has led free-market reform in recent years, would do well.\n\"The early results appear pleasantly good for ODS. To me, if these continue, it could be a good result for the market,\" said Jan Sykora of Prgaue brokerage Wood and Co.\nPundits have billed the Senate elections as an indicator of whether the Czech Republic can break out of a political impasse following inconclusive lower house polls which stripped Klaus's conservative coalition of its majority last June.\nBut the apparent low turnout, which compares with 76.4 percent in June, seems a vindication of the Republicans and their leader Miroslav Sladek.\nSladek regards the Senate as a waste of time and money. \"They had nowhere to dump the political zombies so they established the Senate,\" he told a recent anti-election rally, adding that it \"would be lazy, useless and expensive\".\nOne complaint among voters was that many of the Senate candidates were unknown as government and opposition leaders all sit in the lower Chamber of Deputies. Few Czechs have much idea of what the Senate will do.\nConventional wisdom has been that if ODS did well in the Senate Klaus might provoke early lower house polls to regain the coalition's majority. If ODS lost to the Social Democrats, however, he could be forced to resign after seven years leading economic reform as finance minister and since 1992 as premier.\nBut Jiri Pehe, research director at the Open Media Research Institute (OMRI), said these theories may not be valid.\nODS is better at mobilising its supporters than the Social Democrats when interest is low. A big ODS win on a low turnout might therefore not be representative for lower house polls.\n\"If there is a low turnout, even if Klaus wins, I think that it would be very difficult for the ODS to know the real mood of the country,\" he said.",

But the fact that we didn't score at home is not a very good showing,\" he said.\nAdded Jagr: \"We aren't that bad, but our performance is not showing it.\"\nBukac, who has often expressed his disdain for bringing in players who have talent but not team spirit refused to comment on whether he would invite the same team back if he could do it all again.\nBut with nine players on the roster with seven or less of national team games under their belts, the Czech players know they must come together quickly, or face the embarassment of failing to win in what is touted as the true battle for hockey supremacy.\n\"We've got to concentrate on winning against Germany and moving on to the next round, nothing else,\" added Robert Reichel, who recently re-signed with the Calgary Flames after playing one year in Germany.\nThe win allows Sweden to keep pace with group leaders Finland, who have also won both their games so far but have a better goal difference.\nThe two teams meet on Sunday in Stockholm while the Czechs must regroup and beat winless Germany in Garmisch-Partenkirchen on Saturday to move into the quarterfinals next week in North America.",

If ODS lost to the Social Democrats, however, he could be forced to resign after seven years leading economic reform as finance minister and since 1992 as premier.",

I don't think I have ever played this well,\" said Prinosil, who enjoyed straight set victories over Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek, American Todd Martin and Briton Tim Henman on his way to the final and a prize of $64,000.\nKorda said: \"I was a little drained from yesterday's match and he hit the ball well.

        "Text": "Top managers in major financial firms need to be razor-sharp if the world's increasingly complex markets are to run smoothly, however sophisticated the regulatory regime, regulators and politicians said on Thursday.\n\"Management needs to know its business. (It) sets the ethos of the company,\" Alistair Darling, spokesman on treasury affairs for Britain's opposition Labour party told a conference on financial regulation and minimising systemic risk.\nExamples of where rules had been broken by so-called \"rogue traders\" were a clear sign of management failure, he said.\nChristine Cumming, senior vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, also voiced doubts about management's current ability to deal with regulatory problems.\nThe health of an institution lay in its management and directors, but they were not necessarily properly armed to deal with problems when they arose, she said.\n\"Do we prepare directors and managers enough?\" Cumming said.\nBritain's often criticised regulatory system, which relies heavily on so-called \"self-regulation,\" is also under scrutiny.\nDarling said that whichever party won the next general election, due by May 1997, the British regulatory system \"will be reformed.\" But this would not mean \"tearing everything up or dramatic change,\" he added.\nHe said Labour wanted to establish a regulator with sufficient \"clout reputation and stature\" to deal with its international counterparts.\nBut it would not create a \"Super-SIB,\" an enlarged version of the top regulator the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), as some commentators have suggested. A Labour government would also attempt to limit the number of regulations.\nDarling's call for minimising the regulatory burden by making it as cost-effective as possible was echoed by most of the speakers at the conference.\nAngela Knight, Britain's economic secretary to the Treasury, said the government wants to see a cost-benefit analysis applied to all regulations. If they fail to make sense on this basis then they should not be adopted, she said.\nKnight also underlined the dramatic effect on the industry as a whole of the collapse of blue-blooded merchant bank Barings in February 1995 was \"a more salutory lesson than any regulation\" to other banks and financial institutions.\nThere were calls from both politicians for interchange between industry and the regulators, so that the experiences on either side of the fence could be carried across by individuals.\nBut while the idea of the regulators being staffed by people with first-hand industry knowledge won support from many of those attending the meeting, the question of how the pay structure could accomodate such movements was seen by some as a serious obstacle to this system spreading.\nAnd while regulators need to keep up with rapid changes in financial instruments and the industry landscape both on a domestic and a global scale, they can never be expected to be one step ahead of the business they are monitoring.\n\"Regulators should respond to business realities rather than be ahead of business trends,\" Sir Andrew Large, chairman of the SIB told the meeting.\nThis would mean regulators becoming increasingly sophisticated to cope with the changing business environment and having to co-operate more and more with their counterparts in other countries.\n\"The next generation of supervisors will have to evaluate far more complex information and make far more complex judgements,\" Large said.",

We on the other hand are good at our particular core areas of investment management...we think that's a very good marriage,\" Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Hermes, said.\nRoss Goobey said Hermes had approached Liberty International only to find the group had been considering an approach to Hermes.\n\"It really was a meeting of minds on this. Whether it develops further from this we shall see. I think one step at a time is quite enough for us.\"\nHe said the venture would probably not be up and running until the first quarter of next year as regulatory approval first had to be obtained for the new group.\nThe decision by the giant British Telecom Pension Scheme to transfer assets to the new Hermes Liberty International Pensions funds would give the new venture a boost.\n\"I would hope it gives some people some feeling of security that BT Pension Scheme, which is after all the biggest in the country, is willing to do this,\" he said.\nLiberty plans to sell personal pensions at its regional shopping centres, which are held through a majority-owned subsidiary Capital Shopping Centres.

The merger values AIM at approximately $1.6 billion, Invesco said in a statement.\n\"We are creating a prototype company for the future,\" Bob McCullough, Invesco's chief financial officer, told Reuters.\nInvesco's chairman and chief executive Charles Brady, the man who will lead the new group, said it would have \"the scale necessary for success as a financially strong and independent business operating in an increasingly concentrated industry.\"\nMcCullough stressed the deal was a merger of two companies rather than a takeover, as it had been described in some quarters. The two would combine to focus on revenue enhancement but would retain their individual identities, he added.\n\"Brand awareness will continue. Both will retain their names in the market place,\" he said.\nInvesco said it would fund the merger with the issue of 290 million new shares to existing holders of AIM shares. These would be valued at approximately $1.1 billion. AIM shareholders will own around 45 percent of the enlarged group and be subject to restrictions on selling the shares.\nMcCullough said the merger, which is conditional on approval by both Invesco and AIM shareholders and other approvals, would be non-dilutive and would not have any cost savings built-in. However, there would be cost savings in the future, he said.\nThe merger is not expected to be completed before February.\nMcCullough also said the $500 million needed to fund the merger would come in the form of cash and debt, with a one-for-five rights offering on the cards. This would involve issuing roughly 50 million new shares, he said.\nMcCullough said the cost of the merger was not excessive. \"If you look at it on the basis of funds under management, it (the cost) is less than three percent,\" he said.\n\"There's no question that it is a lot of money, but we view this as a long-term investment for both of us,\" he said. This long-term commitment was underlined by the fact that almost 50 percent of the combined shares would be held by management.\nInvesco had been approached by a number of banks offering it loans, with the debt element being placed with them. Both companies were currently \"largely debt free,\" he said.\nThe merger presented an enormous number of synergies, with the two companies using different distribution channels and approaches. McCullough said he did not forsee any culture clash between the two.\nThere would be no change in their differing approaches, with Invesco continuing to be a \"no-load\" house, selling products direct to the customer, and AIM making its sales through intermediaries.\nBoth companies were \"really active managers\" and would stay that way rather than moving to passive management, McCullough said, adding that Invesco's global infrastructure presented a major opportunity.\nHe denied the heavy exposure to the U.S. would hinder Invesco from making the most of opportunities in other parts of the world. \"We would like nothing better than to find opportunities in Asia and Europe,\" he said.\nThe merger would enhance the group's strength in the U.S., increasing the amount of its business there from between 85 and 90 percent to around 95 percent.",

Its 50 percent stake in the umbrella group Lazard Partners was negotiated during the 1980s.\nAnalysts suggest Lazards does not fit into Pearson's main information, education and entertainment divisions and is therefore a target for being spun off. But banking sources point out that Lazards has been a profitable venture and not a drain.\n\"It (Lazards) has not required any capital or management time (from Pearson),\" the senior financier added.\nPearson, in its 1995 annual report and accounts, points out that its \"close ties to the three Lazard investment banking houses again proved their worth in 1995\".\nIt highlighted attributable profits of 39.9 million pounds from the group for that year. If Pearson, described by Michel David-Weill -- senior partner of Lazard Freres in Paris -- as a \"great partner\" to Lazards since 1919, decides to sever its ties with the merchant bank, there could also be other complications.\nThe Lazard group, which has successfully specialised in corporate finance advisory work as well as asset mangagment and trading activities, holds 48 million Pearson shares.\nThe Financial Times at the weekend quoted David-Weill as saying Lazards might decide to sell this 360 million pound ($600 million) stake to finance a buy-back of Pearson's holding.\nThe newspaper said David-Weill had said the Lazards holding in Pearson was equivalent in value to Pearson's Lazard stake.\nAlthough Lazards's stake has been seen as obstacle to a takeover attempt against Pearson, it might sell its shares on the market but in discussion with the group and \"not to a party which could be hostile\", David-Weill told the paper.\nWhile Scardino's role at Pearson has been the subject of close scrutiny since her appointment, Lazards have also been in the news, with suggestions of a power-struggle over who will succeed 64-year-old David-Weill.",

        "Text": "British property company Greycoat Plc, under fire from a group of shareholders calling for it to be broken up, said on Monday it was confident of getting the support of its institutional shareholders in rejecting the plan.\n\"I would be very surprised if they (Greycoat's institutional shareholders) would come down on the side of a closing down sale,\" Greycoat's chief executive Peter Thornton told Reuters.\nThornton said he believed the liquidation proposal by the UK Active Value Fund, which will be put to shareholders in 10-days time, was \"ill-conceived and fails to secure shareholder value\".  \nEarlier Greycoat wrote to its shareholders urging them to reject the resolution, put forward by rebel shareholder Brian Myerson, at an extraordinary general meeting on November 14.\nMyerson's Active Value Advisors Ltd (AVA) advises the UK Active Value Fund and is expected to put out its own response to the statement later today.\nLast month Myerson said it was time to \"unlock the value of Greycoat\" as the company's shares stood at a 23 percent discount to the forecast net asset value for 1997.\nHe said there was \"considerable support\" for the proposal to dispose of Greycoat's assets and enhance shareholder value.  \nGreycoat, which focuses on central London office developments, earlier announced a rise in interim pre-tax profits to 3.8 million stg and predicted a final dividend of 1.2 pence per share.\nThornton said the results showed the company was having a very good year, adding it was well placed to take advantage of favourable investor sentiment on the central London property market. \"The whole market is moving in our direction,\" he said.\nThe share discount to net asset value had been worsened by the fact that UKAV held 10 percent of the shares and this was overhanging the market, he added.  \nMartin Poole, Greycoat's finance director, said the company had got its long-term debt in place, adding that its lender banks were not in any way ruffled by the current uncertainty.\n\"The novelty has worn off from the bank's point of view,\" Poole told Reuters. To get rid of the bank debt, which would be required by any liquidation plans, would cost \"roughly 10 million stg\", he added.\nPoole said he expected good growth in the dividend in the medium term, in line with the group's policy of progressively increasing it. \"There is no reason why we shouldn't continue at the higher rate of profit,\" he said.  \nWhile Greycoat does not intend to use further resources on development sites, it is likely to use the cash generated by the sale of its Buckingham Palace Road property for investment.\nThornton said discussions were already underway with several parties, but he stressed the company would not pay over the odds, would not compromise on what it wanted and would not buy anything in the market.\nRather than concentrating on a single asset, there would be two or three purchases or \"possibly more\". Greycoat had around 50 million stg to spend and this would be geared up to around 50 million stg cash and the same amount of debt, Thornton added.",

        "Text": "Britain's Halifax Building Society is confident of avoiding any takeover attempts once it sheds its mutual status and becomes a publicly quoted bank in June next year, a senior official said on Thursday.\n\"We think we can stand on our own feet,\" David Gilchrist, Halifax's director of corporate affairs said in a telephone interview following the announcement of the timetable for the planned conversion and 10 billion stg flotation.\nThe building society's nine million members -- its savers and borrowers -- will vote on the conversion early next year.  \nGilchrist said the building society's decision to convert by transferring its business to an existing subsidiary rather than to a company specially formed for conversion meant it would lose a five-year protection against takeover.\nIt will also increase the voting threshold needed to give the plans the go-ahead. But he was confident that it would achieve a sufficiently high vote in favour, of at least 50 percent of all investing members entitled to vote.\n\"We have no real concerns as far as the voting is concerned,\" he said, adding that previous building society conversions achieved approvals of over 75 percent.  \n\"It will be a high-profile exercise, backed up by plenty of marketing,\" Gilchrist said.\nEarlier, the Halifax said its members would be given full details of the conversion plans and share distribution scheme in January 1997. This will tell them the number of shares they are entitled to receive and an indication of their likely price range, based on prevailing market conditions at the time.\nGilchrist said members would get a \"broad idea\" at this time, but would not be drawn on what the share hand-out was likely to be worth to the average investor.  \nHe also declined to comment on what the cost of the conversion exercise would be, saying only that a significant element would be printing and postage costs.\n\"The major element of cost is printing and mailing. We will be sending 75 million items of mail,\" he said.\nHalifax members will be urged to vote \"as quickly as possible\" on the proposals and a special general meeting will be held in Sheffield in February. If members vote in favour, they will be sent details of share allocations in April or May.\nGilchrist said the Halifax had not yet done any market research on how many members would sell or retain shares.  \n\"We are not trying to persuade people one way or another whether to hold shares or to sell the shares,\" he said, adding the Halifax would sound out members nearer the time.\nBut it was working on the basis that a \"large number\" would have already planned to spend their windfall and had set up a share dealing system to ensure an orderly market for what will be the largest single extension of private share ownership ever in Britain, Gilchrist added.\nThose who decide to sell will be offered a free-of-charge postal service for a limited period while those who keep them can chose between placing them in a nominee company or receiving a share certificate. The Halifax favours the nominee option.\nThe society will remind its members that they should have at least 100 stg in total in their accounts on December 31 1996.\nIf eligible for a variable distribution of extra free shares they \"may need to top up their share accounts to the November 25 1994 level by the date of the special general meeting\" to qualify for the maximum number of free shares, the Halifax said.",

We looked at what was lacking (in Canary Wharf) and that was life,\" Thio Gim Hock, executive director of HPL, told Reuters in an interview.\nHPL and Canary Wharf, which is owned by an international consortium led by Paul Reichmann and including Prince Al Waleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz al Saud of Saudi Arabia, formed an 80-20 joint venture for the residential, hotel and leisure project.\nThe multi-million pound scheme represents the first phase of development of an 11-acre (4.5 hectare) site adjoining the River Thames. It will be part of the landmark Canary Wharf docklands development to the east of the City financial district, home to Britain's tallest building.\nThe development will be the first at the massive Canary Wharf site since an agreement last year by banks to sell out to the Reichmann-led consortium. The banks had taken over the ownership when the original development company went into administration.\nDespite these problems, 80 percent of the offices have now been occupied and Canary Wharf is vying with the London's traditional financial heartland as a site for large global investment banks to locate their new headquarters.\nOffice blocks have so far dominated the site, however, and Thio Gim Hock said he expects to start building 330 residential units, a five star hotel and sports club early in 1997. They are due to be completed by the end of 1998 or early 1999.\nThere is already outline planning permission from the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) to develop the site and Canary Wharf's Robert John, a director of the joint venture, believes detailed permission should be granted.\nAn initial capitalisation of 50 million pounds ($83.95 million) will come from the partners. Further funding is expected to come from sale of apartments and bank loans, although Thio Gim Hock would not be drawn on the financing.\nHPL, which has a stake in Britain's Virgin Cinemas as well as interests in hotels such as Four Seasons and residential developments, said in July the Canary Wharf scheme would cost around 250 million pounds, although the total cost is likely to be higher given the estimates for the first phase.\nDesigner Philippe Stark is to shape the hotel and leisure component of the new development, which will include a glass-covered \"infinity\" swimming pool which will give the appearance of dropping into the river Thames below.\nThio Gim Hock said Stark will \"give some sex appeal to the development\", which he says will have a country club atmosphere. He wants the hotel to have its own distinctive character which will be \"elegant, understated and aimed at business people\".\nThe developers also envisage opportunities for top-class restaurants with river views on the site.\nHe expects many of the apartments to be sold to people in Britain, but also hopes for overseas interest and foresees some buyers seeking an investment rather than a place to live. HPL's track-record in Singapore will, he said, encourage interest from the company's home patch.\n\"I have no doubt that a lot of them will come and buy here.\"\nWork on the Canary Wharf project in the former London docks began in 1987 under Olympia and York, owned by the Reichmann family of Canada.",

We are perfectly entitled not to share them,\" Keswick said.\nHambros reported pretax profits of 35.0 million pounds ($57.81 million) for the first half, compared with a 7.7 million pound loss for the same period in 1995.\nSome analysts had forecast pretax profits of up to 45.0 million pounds based on a strong performance by Hambros' estate agent subsidiary Hambro Countrywide.\nThey also predicted an interim dividend range of between 2.5 and 3.0 pence. In the event the dividend was unchanged at 2.5 pence.\nHambros is among a dwindling list of British investment banks which are the constant subject of takeover speculation. However, it has been seen as one of the less attractive targets due to recent poor performance and major provisions for bad debts.\nBad debt provisions for the period were 5.9 million pounds compared with 23.5 million in the same period in 1995.\nAsked about the possibility of Hambros becomin a takeover target for a larger international player, Keswick said a public company was always in the firing line but he was happy with the group's direction.\nWhile he could not talk for shareholders in the group, Keswick said he had the impression from discussions with them in the wake of the Regent Pacific move that they were supportive of changes the company had implemented.\nKeswick said the group was on track to replace \"low margin vanilla business\" with increased return per customer business. It had decided the best strategy was to undergo major upheavals for a year rather than piecemeal changes over a longer period in order to achieve this.\nKeswick, who forecast the benefits of the changes could take a year or two to come through, said he was pleased the group had moved back into profit, adding that the Investment Group's result had been particularly good.\nBut Hambros chairman Lord Hambro warned that profits from this part of the business were not expected to match the first half in the rest of the year.\nHowever, he expected \"considerable improvement\" from Hambros' subsidiaries and, despite a challenging environment for the group as a whole, prospects were good.\nLord Hambro said he would retire from his post in July 1997 and be succeeded by Keswick.",

This values Videotron at around $1.09 billion.\nOnce the merger and the Videotron deal have been completed, Cable & Wireless will own 52.6 percent of the new company -- to be called Cable & Wireless Communications -- with NYNEX owning 18.5 percent and Bell Canada 14.2 percent of the shares.\nThe remaining 15 percent will floated and the groups intend to list the company in both London and New York. This is likely to take place in about six months.\n\"Cable & Wireless Communications will be the only company in the U.K. capable of offering a combination of telecoms, broadband, data transmission, video shopping and Internet access,\" Brown said.\nStephen Pettit, executive director of European operations at C&W, told Reuters Financial Television that the deal would not lead to duplication.\n\"Both Mercury and the cable companies had strategies to dig up the streets and lay cables and they are looking at the same streets.

It has been put forward by the UK Active Value Fund, which is advised by rebel shareholder Brian Myerson's Active Value Advisers.\nUK Active Value Fund bought its 11 percent stake in Greycoat three years ago, rescuing it from receivership. But Myerson's relationship with the firm's management has not run smoothly.\nThe South African financier's challenge to the Greycoat management has also triggered a proposal by Moorfield Estates involving a share exchange offer for the larger Greycoat, which has so far dismissed the approach.\nMoorfield said in a statement on Monday that it had \"developed a proposal to add value for all shareholders through a strategy of more active management of the assets of Greycoat\".\nIt said this had been presented to some of Greycoat's larger shareholders, accounting for close to 40 percent of the shares, and an approach had then been made to Greycoat's chairman.\nThey include merging the two companies by a share exchange and restructuring the assets of the enlarged group.\nThis would involve a Central London portfolio made up initially of Greycoat's main assets, Embankment Place and 123 Buckingham Palace Road, which would later be demerged.\nMoorfield also intends setting up a portfolio of \"investment and development property earmarked for immediate disposal to a major property company\".\nThe remainder of the enlarged group would constitute \"an investment, trading and development portfolio\" and there would be a reorganisation of the management structure to reduce costs by \"at least 1.5 million pounds ($2.47 million) per annum\", Moorfield said.\nWhile analysts agreed the Moorfield plan was unlikely to succeed, some said there was an opportunity for Greycoat to take over another company with higher profitability so the combined company could capitalise on Greycoat's favourable tax position.\n\"But they are not going to be flushed out by Thursday,\" a second property analyst told Reuters, adding that three or four companies had looked \"very seriously\" at the possibility of joining with Greycoat.\nAnother possibility would be a larger group such as British Land sweeping up Greycoat, although such an outcome seems remote in the short-term, analysts said.\nMyerson's proposed sale of Greycoat's London property assets is seen by some as an unwise \"forced sale\" which would not achieve shareholder value in what is an improving market.\n\"Generally speaking a forced sale of their assets would not gain anything in the short term,\" the first analyst said, adding that with rental growth starting to show through, it made sense to hold onto Greycoat's two largest properties.\n\"They are vulnerable to any change in market conditions, but it would be a mistake to be forced into a corner and to sell something in a relatively short timescale. It would be totally counterproductive,\" he added.\nBut others said the time was right to sell off Greycoat's largest assets. \"This is exactly the right time of the cycle (to sell,\" the second analyst said.",

But not all the rules are compulsory and some firms have opted not to toe the line.\nThis has led to a more active approach by leading institutional shareholders like Norwich Union and has seen greater involvement from bodies such as the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension funds.\n\"Institutional shareholders are paying a lot more attention to these issues, not perhaps out of choice but because of circumstances. We do think remuneration issues are important but perhaps get more publicity than they should,\" Anita Skipper, corporate governance manager at Norwich Union told Reuters.\nSkipper said the group, which has been looking at corporate governance issues for more than a decade, does not generally give a view on the general package an executive receives, but tries to ensure a company's performance justifies the benefit.\nThis means close scrutiny of every aspect of the company's performance, including factors such as its return on capital, cashflow, the way it is managed and its prospects.\n\"It's good to see the big investing institutions flexing their muscles and taking an active interest in this way,\" one industry insider told Reuters.\nLast week Tim Melville-Ross, director general of the Institute of Directors, rallied behind Simpson, arguing that very few people were capable of doing the job.\nMelville-Ross also sat on the Greenbury panel which urged the remuneration committees - which decide directors' salaries - to take into account the wider scene, including pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the company and industry.\nA row over a new executive bonus scheme at British power and water giant United Utilities in July fuelled public outrage at the million-pound packages that executive directors of monopoly utilities have managed to amass since privatisation.\nLast year, chairman of Marks and Spencer Sir Richard Greenbury was given the job of attempting to impose curbs following public outrage over the pay of Cedric Brown, formerly the chief executive of British Gas.\n\"That was a watershed. That was what raised public awareness of the issue (of directors' pay),\" Norwich Union's Skipper said.\nThe Greenbury committee said a number of privatised water and energy companies \"have developed, perhaps unintentionally, remuneration packages which are richer than required to recruit, retain and motivate quality managers\".\nSkipper maintains that revealing directors' pay is a requirement of good corporate governance. \"It should be there for shareholder scrutiny,\" she said.\nBut her view is not appreciated by all directors. One director of a quoted financial institution, recently told Reuters he was firmly against having his salary and pension details published not least because of the potential personal repurcussions.\nHis mother-in-law happens to be a shareholder and receives the company's annual report and accounts and he confided that she has since hinted she will re-write her will in favour of her other children.",

These results, our second best interim results ever, show we can remain independent,\" a Robert Fleming spokesman told Reuters.\nFlemings has been widely talked about as a possible takeover target for a larger foreign investment bank, but has resolutely said it would retain its independence.\nFlemings said its pretax profit for the first half of the year had increased by 16 percent to 92.2 million pounds ($154 million), from 79.4 million pounds a year earlier but warned it would have to cope with difficult markets in the second half.\nSome analysts said the increase was not particularly impressive given market conditions but chief executive John Manser said it was \"a very good start\" and showed new businesses were \"making a valuable contribution to profitability.\"\n\"While the outlook for the year seems promising, flat Asian markets and heightened competitive pressures in other markets are factors that we will continue to have to contend with during the next six months,\" Manser said in a statement.\nThe Flemings official said the results showed that while Flemings may have been perceived as an Asian-centric bank, it was now a much more international operation and had succeeded in bringing down its cost income ratio.\nFlemings has not had an easy year so far. In July it lost investment banking head Bill Harrison who was poached by BZW, the investment banking arm of Britain's Barclays.\nAnd in August Jardine Fleming, a joint venture with Jardine Matheson, revealed a five-month probe by British and Hong Kong regulators into irregular trades by a former senior fund manager at Jardine Fleming Investment Management.\nThis resulted in hefty fines and voluntary compensation of nearly $20 million to clients.

These results, our second best interim results ever, show we can remain independent,\" a Robert Fleming spokesman told Reuters.\nFlemings has been widely talked about as a possible takeover target for a larger foreign investment bank, but has resolutely said it would retain its independence.\nFlemings said its pretax profit for the first half of the year had increased by 16 percent to 92.2 million pounds ($154 million), from 79.4 million pounds a year earlier but warned it would have to cope with difficult markets in the second half.\nSome analysts said the increase was not particularly impressive given market conditions but chief executive John Manser said it was \"a very good start\" and showed new businesses were \"making a valuable contribution to profitability.\"\n\"While the outlook for the year seems promising, flat Asian markets and heightened competitive pressures in other markets are factors that we will continue to have to contend with during the next six months,\" Manser said in a statement.\nThe Flemings official said the results showed that while Flemings may have been perceived as an Asian-centric bank, it was now a much more international operation and had succeeded in bringing down its cost income ratio.\nFlemings has not had an easy year so far. In July it lost investment banking head Bill Harrison who was poached by BZW, the investment banking arm of Britain's Barclays.\nAnd in August Jardine Fleming, a joint venture with Jardine Matheson, revealed a five-month probe by British and Hong Kong regulators into irregular trades by a former senior fund manager at Jardine Fleming Investment Management.\nThis resulted in hefty fines and voluntary compensation of nearly $20 million to clients.

But one official has said Wang could appeal to the Higher People's Court if convicted.\nThe New York-based Human Rights Watch said last week the chances of an acquittal were slim because Wang has not had adequate time to prepare a defence.\nThe dissident's family has found a lawyer willing to defend the former student leader after being given just one day in which to do so.\nThe human rights group said Chinese criminal trials seldom respect the presumption of innocence, and defence lawyers are generally restricted to arguing mitigating circumstances for a reduced sentence.\nWang's court appearance would likely be held out of the public eye, as was last year's trial of Wei Jingsheng, regarded as the father of China's tiny, struggling democracy movement.\nThe Chinese authorities have been quiet on a request by the U.S. Embassy in Beijing to send observers to Wang's trial, diplomats said.\nFrench senator Robert Badinter, former U.S. attorneys general Nicholas Katzenback and Richard Thornburgh, and former Canadian solicitor-general Warren Allmand have also said they want to observe Wang's trial.\nForeign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang on Tuesday shrugged off questions from reporters about the status of the requests, saying Wang's trial was China's internal affairs.\nBeijing has repeatedly come under fire from the West for human rights abuses. It says foreign intervention in China's internal affairs is not welcomed.\nWang's mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, would attend the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister would be allowed to sit in.\nThe mother has said the dissident was calm and mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, although she has said his health has deteriorated during his detention.\nWang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.\nHe was active after his parole in 1993, defying persistent police surveillance to join a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of all those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.\nChina has recently cracked down on the few remaining dissidents who have not fled into exile or been jailed.",

She declined to provide further details.\nThe Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court took less than four hours last Wednesday to convict and sentence Wang, who had already served four years in prison for his role as a leader of the 1989 student demonstrations for democracy that were crushed by the military with heavy loss of life.\nOn Monday, visiting Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said he had expressed his disapproval to Chinese Premier Li Peng over the jailing of Wang.\nA foreign ministry spokesman defended China at a news briefing on Tuesday, saying Beijing would not impose its laws on others and that foreign countries should take a similar stance.\nThe spokesman also said China opposed using human rights as a pretext to interfere in the internal affairs of any country.\nAn international human rights group denounced what it said was the \"secret trial\" of Wang on a trumped-up charge.\n\"What (the court) brought to bear on Wang Dan was a secret trial in which the facts were deliberately hidden and the truth distorted,\" the New York-based Human Rights in China said in a statement made available to Reuters by facsimile.\n\"A fabricated charge was used to wantonly convict Wang Dan,\" the group said. \"Wang Dan's case... is suppression and persecution of thought and speech by the Chinese government.\"\nWhen told during the trial of his right to seek the removal of any biased judges, Wang demanded all judges and prosecutors be removed from the case. The tribunal rejected his request after a few minutes of deliberation, the group said.\nChina said it was an open and fair trial but Human Rights in China said no foreign reporters, diplomats or other international observers were allowed to attend.\nThe group said more than 10 people wearing tags identifying themselves as reporters attended the trial but there was no mention of the conviction in the local Chinese-language media.\nThe jailing of Wang was the latest in a series of crushing blows to China's struggling pro-democracy movement. Most dissidents have already been forced into exile or are serving long sentences in prison or labour camps.\nHuman Rights in China accused the official Xinhua news agency of preparing English-language stories about the results of the trial and an interview with the chief judge even before the verdict was delivered.\nAsked to comment, an official of the foreign affairs office of Xinhua said: \"It is not necessary to find out whether the story was prepared before or after the sentencing... News agencies have different ways and practices of releasing news.\"\nAfter breaking the news of Wang's conviction, it took Xinhua only 1-1/2 hours to put out a 54-paragraph story on the interview with the chief judge.",

Mou declined repeated requests for an interview.\nDomestic creditors had demanded repayment of loans, group officials said. Mou's Land Economic Group owes 200 million yuan ($24.1 million) at home and another 200 million yuan in Hong Kong and Russia.\n\"Some creditors...have asked for their money back even before the maturity date,\" Chen said, adding that the company was planning to repay the loans gradually.\nDomestic banks had refused to grant Mou new loans and the group had given up seeking loans from Chinese banks. \"Abruptly recalling loans could be fatal,\" Chen said in an interview.\nAt least one investor had demanded its money back, but agreed to convert its equity into a loan, company officials said.\n\"The major problem we're facing now is circulating funds getting cut off... As a result, many projects are held up,\" Chen said.\nGovernment authorities had cleared Mou of suspicion of tax evasion and of using unlawful funds but he remained under investigation for other unspecified irregularities, company officials said.\nThe authorities had been dragging their feet on renewing his passport apparently out of fear that he may flee the country and join his wife and three sons in the United States. Mou hopes to visit the United States next month.\nSalaries of employees were slashed to 270 yuan a month -- China's urban minimum wage -- in July and August and were 600 yuan in September from an average of 2,000 yuan a month in the past, the officials said. About 50 people have resigned, leaving some 300.\nA contractor in Inner Mongolia had sued the Land Group for allegedly defaulting on a contract, and court officials foreclosed on company cars and office equipment in August.\n\"Many people say that this could be what is called in Buddhism an inexorable doom for Mr Mou or the Land Group,\" Chen said.\nChen blamed the woes of Mou on the media \"surrounding and attacking\" him since March as well as a smear campaign by former employees and a government credit squeeze to curb inflation.\n\"But the Land Group will not collapse,\" she said.\nMou plans to raise an unspecified amount of money through a planned share issue, for two Russian-made GALS communications satellites he owns, on the Hong Kong stock exchange, officials said.\nThe first was launched in January 1994 and the second in November 1995. Russia launched both satellites in Kazakhstan.\nIn addition, Mou has bought a 30 percent stake in a company that will develop, manufacture and launch two Russian-made Intersputnik communications satellites.\nThe first of the two satellites is due to be launched from Kazakhstan in late 1998.\nThe satellites were expected to bring Mou net profits of $500 million and bail him out of his current crisis, Chen said.\nThe group has assets worth 1.2 billion yuan and liabilities of just 400 million yuan.\nIt is not Mou's first crisis. He was sentenced to death but eluded execution in the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution for criticising chairman Mao Zedong.\nMou was released from prison in 1979 and established his company the following year. He was arrested again and jailed for one year on a charge of speculating in the early 1980s.\nHe ran up huge debts in the mid 1980s but managed to bounce back by importing small refrigerators from South Korea at low tariff rates, raking in millions of yuan.",

        "Text": "China's exports climbed again in October due to sluggish domestic demand, faster payment of export tax rebates and an expansion of credit to exporters, newspapers and a government economist said on Wednesday.\nThe upturn in exports was expected to continue through the first half of 1997, said Wang Jian, a researcher with the cabinet's State Planning Commission.\nExports rose for the fourth consecutive month in October, jumping 23.3 percent to $15.22 billion from a year ago, said the International Business Daily, a newspaper published by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.\nThe healthy exports performance helped the nation register its biggest monthly trade surplus of the year. The surplus stood at $3.91 billion in October compared with $3.2 billion in September, the newspaper said.\n\"This kind of rebound in exports ... is estimated to last until the first half of next year,\" Wang told Reuters in a telephone interview.\nWang attributed the upturn to slow domestic demand, forcing manufacturers to look to overseas markets.\nAlso, domestic enterprises had adjusted to a cut in government-paid export tax rebates, he said. The government slashed the rebate on exports of industrial products to 9.0 percent from 14.0 percent on January 1, 1996.\nThe International Business Daily said exports rebounded because the government sped up the payment of export tax rebates and expanded credit to exporters.\nExports slumped in the first six months of 1996, dented by rising wages and the relative strength of the currency, the renminbi.\nA slowdown in government payments of tax rebates to exporters had also discouraged many firms from exporting their goods earlier in the year. Many of those firms focused sales on the domestic market instead.\nHowever, the government has been stepping up payment of export rebates to try to revive exports.\nImports inched up a year-on-year three percent to $11.31 billion in October, the Business Daily said.\nThe import data showed that the impact of this year's tariff cuts has gradually weakened, it said.\nIn the first 10 months of this year, China's exports totalled $119.22 billion, mostly unchanged from the same 1995 period, the newspaper said. But imports added up to $107.21 billion, a rise of 5.5 percent from the year-ago period.\nThe latest figures brought the total trade surplus for the January-to-October period to $12.01 billion, it said.\nJapan, the United States and Europe remained China's largest export markets.\nChina's exports to Japan rose a year-on-year 8.6 percent to $24.5 billion in the first 10 months of this year, the daily said. Exports to the United States and Europe increased 5.5 percent and 4.5 percent to $21.3 billion and $18.9 billion respectively.\nMachinery and electronic exports totalled $38 billion in the first 10 months, accounting for one-third of total exports and up 11 percent from the year-ago period, the newspaper said.\nExports of toys, furniture, shoes, crude oil and plastic products increased in the first 10 months. But exports of textile yarn and related products, garment, steel and aquatic products all fell, it said.\nImports by foreign-funded enterprises in the first 10 months soared a year-on-year 23 percent to $105.0 billion.\nCar imports plunged 39 percent year-on-year between January and October, the newspaper said.

Tokyo has said it would not recognise a lighthouse built on one of the islands by Japanese rightwingers this year.\nJapanese rightwingers sailed to the islands in July and repaired the lighthouse, rekindling the dispute.\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang on Tuesday accused Japan of taking an irresponsibile approach by encouraging landings on the islands by the rightwing groups.\nShen warned that the will of the Chinese people \"cannot be bullied\" and that sovereignty ranked above everything else.\nThe row was aggravated last week when a Hong Kong activist drowned after diving into stormy seas near the islands as part of a protest against Tokyo's sovereignty claim.\nTokyo's claim dates back to 1895, when it defeated imperial China and seized the uninhabited islands. Japan says the issue is not open for discussion.\nChina has claimed sovereignty over the islands for centuries.\nTaiwan has no diplomatic ties with Japan, which only recognises Beijing's Communist government.\nThe China Daily commentary also slammed the LDP's election platform for containing an endorsement of visits by cabinet ministers to a Tokyo shrine to Japan's war dead.\n\"Japanese politicians have waged a war to reverse the verdict on Japan's war shame concluded by the world half a century ago,\" the commentary said.\nJapanese prime minister and LDP leader Ryutaro Hashimoto in July broke a decade-long taboo on prime ministerial visits to Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine, saying it was time for Japan to stop apologising for honouring its fallen soldiers.\n\"Such dishonest activities, which reinvigorate militarism, have naturally caused indignation in the war-victimised countries,\" the newspaper commentary said in reference to visits to the shrine by Japanese leaders.\nLast week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang expressed strong indignation over the LDP's election platform.",

The country led by our Communist Party cannot let families be this destitute,\" she said.\nChina has about 65 million people still struggling to get by with incomes under the official absolute poverty line of 530 yuan ($64) a year, officials say.\nIn September, Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin vowed to \"gnaw the hard bone\" of poverty by pouring funds into the drive to raise living standards for the poorest segment of the nation by the turn of the century.\nThe communists, who swept to power in 1949 on public resentment against widespread poverty and corruption, fear the widening gap between rich and poor today could spark social unrest and undermine its grip on power.\nChina says it reduced the number of people living in abject poverty by five million in 1995.\nAbout 3,500 destitute mothers in western and southwestern China were expected to benefit from Tuesday's auction.\nProceeds would go to an anti-poverty fund headed by the former first lady to lend money to impoverished mothers to help them get started in farming, raise livestock or make handicrafts to earn a living in future, Wang said.\nThe fund would also provide education and give medical treatment to destitute mothers, she said.",

But Jiang may be desperate.\nAnalysts said Jiang remained overshadowed by Deng, architect of the market-oriented economic reforms and still influential even without an official post and despite increasingly fragile health.\n\"In the midst of his great triumph, Jiang Zemin if he is all that powerful...there is no need for him to go out of his way to mention Deng Xiaoping,\" a Western diplomat said referring to the communique that tips its hat to Deng.\n\"Jiang Zemin...is still in consolidation mode...in the process of selling himself,\" he said. \"The jury is still out.\"\nJiang is eager to consolidate his power base even after amassing the three most important positions in China -- general secretary of the Communist Party, state president and chairman of party's powerful Central Military Commission.\nMany diplomats see Jiang as a transitional figure after the death of Deng, which is widely expected to trigger a scramble for power among those eager to succeed him as the de facto emperor of the world's most populous nation.",

Beijing regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation.\n\"I would like to suggest here... that the two sides resume as soon as possible talks on trade and investment,\" Kao said.\nTaiwanese newspapers said Kao would meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other senior officials during the current trip, which comes less than two weeks after President Lee called for a review of economic policy toward China with the aim of avoiding overdependence on the mainland.\nTaipei's China Times Express newspaper said on Sunday that Taiwan's economic planners had drawn up measures -- including contingency plans to restrict Taiwanese investment on the mainland -- if Taiwan-China relations deteriorated.\nLi, the Chinese vice-premier, took a swipe at President Lee, saying no one could block direct trade and transport links between China and Taiwan, rivals from the time of the Chinese civil war that ended in 1949.\n\"Economic development between the two sides is the general trend and no single person can obstruct this,\" Li said.\n\"Any person who tries to place artificial barriers to restrict economic cooperation is going against the will of the people of the two sides,\" he said.\nHe also told the seminar he hoped Taiwan authorities would allow direct links as soon as possible.\nIndirect links between the two sides have been allowed since the late 1980s, through Hong Kong or a third country.\nMany Taiwanese businessmen, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, are eager for direct trade and transport links. But Taiwan has been reluctant to lift the ban, which it views as its last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.\nChina has been pressing Taiwan to open direct links. Last week, China introduced a series of regulations to pave the way for direct shipping links.\nThe Taiwanese delegation is the largest to visit China since a trend of easing tensions was reversed by Taiwan President Lee's mid-1995 visit to the United States.",

        "Text": "An inquiry into Australia's financial system has left open the option of mergers among Australia's big banks and takeovers of local banks by foreign banks in an interim discussion paper released on Wednesday.\nThe inquiry, established by the government and headed by prominent businessman Stan Wallis, outlined various options for reform and was careful not to state its own preferences.\nBut it said the key aim of any reforms should be increasing the efficiency of Australia's banks to compete globally and that new technology would transform the sector. Big banks such as the National Australia Bank Ltd have used the same reasoning lobbying for relaxed merger rules.\nThe banks have said big bank mergers are necessary to compete globally and new technology such as the Internet and global competition meant such mergers would not cut competition.\nPolicy set by the former Labor government has stopped mergers or foreign takeovers of Australia's four largest banks and its two largest insurance and superannuation groups.\nThe current conservative coalition government has said this so-called \"six pillars\" policy will remain in place until it has considered the Wallis inquiry's recommendations, due to be delivered by the end of March 1997.\n\"The Inquiry sees as its key goal the identification of means to increase the efficiency of the Australian financial system, without compromising its safety and peformance,\" the paper said. Increased efficiency was needed to complete globally, to obtain the benefits of new technology and to increase investment returns, the paper said. It asked if competition and innovation could be stimulated by widening access to traditional banking activities through:\n* \"Allowing direct non-bank access to the payments settlement system\"\n* Better accomodating financial conglomerates\n* Allowing an increased range of institutions to provide a wider array of financial services, or\n* relaxing some of the ownership restrictions on financial institutuions ?\"\nThe inquiry said it was also wanted any reforms to increase competition and asked in that context \"whether there are any public policy grounds for restrictions on foreign acquisitions in the banking or insurance industries?\"\nIn discussing the details of how bank mergers might be approved, the inquiry said there was widespread consensus that banks should be subject to the same competition rules as other industries. Currently any bank merger must be approved by the government through the Treasurer and by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). This dual approval process does not apply in other industries.  \n\"In undertaking its assessment, the Inquiry notes its preference...for all sectors of the economy to be subject to a uniform set of competitionpolicy laws unless there is something sepcial which justifies different treatment,\" the paper said.\nThe Inquiry said it would consider the following options for merger approvals, including;\n* keeping the current system of dual approval\n* having the Treasurer accept the ACCC's decision, or * narrowing powers over mergers in banking and insurance law It said there would be no need for a 'six pillars' policy if the Treasurers powers were removed or if he agreed not to excercise them. \"There was almost unanimous support that the 'six pillars' policy should be abolished,\" the paper said.",

If they run out they can easily borrow some of the cargo,\" Kumkee told Reuters by telephone from Tarawa, one of a group of coral atolls about 5,000 kms (3,000 miles) north-east of Sydney.\nThe cargo included rice and tinned food.\nNone of the passengers or crew had been injured in the fire and the only problem on board was likely to be boredom given the ship's video players were out of action. \"With no videos, they'll be a bit bored,\" Kumkee said.\nMost of the passengers were sitting or sleeping under canvas on blankets on the deck, he said.\nThey would be reduced to playing cards and their guitars until their rescue, he added.\nThe MV Maasmond is registered in Kingstown in St Vincent and Grenadines, according to the Lloyds List, and has had engine trouble in the past.\nIn 1992, it underwent engine repairs for ten weeks after encountering cyclones on a cruise through the Pacific.",

Email also cut its interim dividend to eight cents from 11.5 a year earlier, saying it had realigned dividends to reflect the stronger second half year in the light of continuing uncertainty about the economy.\nEmail Managing Director John Hanna later told Reuters Email expected pre-tax profits for the second half of the 1996/97 year would also be above those in the second half of 1995/96.  \n\"We are expecting in the second half that we would have pre-tax operating profits higher than last year,\" Hanna said.\n\"We should also have the second half seasonal lift.\"\nHe said Email was pleased that it achieved profit growth in its building products and major appliances divisions despite lower sales.\nAnalysts said the result was within expectations and was largely unsurprising, even with the dividend cut.\n\"It's still a high payout ratio,\" said one Sydney analyst said of the dividend, noting that the final dividend was likely to be maintained.  \nEmail's share price was unchanged at A$3.55 at 1.10 p.m. (0210 GMT) on light volumes.\nHanna said there could begin to be an upturn in the housing industry at the beginning of 1997, but that this would take some time to flow through to Email's business because its products were installed late in the building process.\n\"If it (the upturn) was early 1997, then it (the resulting flow-on) would be in mid-1997,\" he said.\nBut this flow-on effect would then have an immediate effect on Email's bottom line because of the recent restructuring which had reduced overheads.  \n\"As there's an upturn, we should get that immediately and a lot of that will go to the bottom line immediately,\" Hanna said.\nHe also said Email may increase its 20 percent stake in British electricity meter maker Ampy Automation Digilog Ltd.\n\"There may be an opportunity to lift that stake in the future,\" Hanna said.

        "Text": "Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd is likely to benefit from the planned US$20 billion merger of MCI Communications Corp and British Telecommunications Plc , Australian media analysts said on Monday.\nThey said News, which already has a wide-ranging partnership with MCI, would strengthen its global media interests on the coat-tails of the creation of the world's second largest telecommunications group.\n\"It means they'll be in bed with a bigger more powerful global telephony group,\" one senior Sydney media analyst said.  \nAnalysts also said the BT-MCI merger would stabilise New Corp's partnership with MCI, which had seemed increasingly strained in recent months. \"It seems that MCI and News haven't been getting on lately, whereas News and BT have been getting on a lot better,\" said the senior Sydney analyst.\nThe prospect of MCI selling its nine percent stake in News Corp over the next year had suppressed News Corp's shares in the last month. \"There was a view that MCI wasn't real happy with it (the partership) and may sell out, but now nothing's going to happen for 12 months at least,\" said another Sydney analyst.  \n\"The implications for News are quite positive,\" the analyst said.\nA Melbourne analyst said some in the market were a bit worried that MCI was preparing to  to sell down their stake over the next 12 months. \"The fact that BT may combine with MCI reduces that risk for now at least,\" the analyst said.\nMCI and News Corp announced a broad alliance in May 1995, under which MCI bought a nine percent stake in News for US$1.35 billion and acquired an option to increase that stake up to 13.5 percent. They agreed, amoug other things, to jointly set up an American satelite television operation -- ASkyB.  \nBut progress with ASkyB has been slow and other smaller joint ventures have failed to fire.\nHowever, the Australian analysts said they would remain somewhat cautious given bearish comments on Sunday by MCI.\nMCI announced that it would cut its stake in ASkyB to 20 percent from 50 percent.\nAnalysts said this was not surprising as News Corp and MCI had said recently they wanted new partners in the venture.  \nBut MCI Chief Executive Bert Roberts also told Reuters on Sunday that no major new launches were expected from the venture with News Corp and that MCI would sell to News a US$700 million satellite license if it could.\nHe also said MCI was unlikely to take up its option to increase its stake in News, a comment seen by analysts as symptomatic of Roberts' increasing unhappiness with the deal.\nAnalysts also said there was the potential for a regulatory block to links between News, its 40 percent owned BSkyB Plc and BT.  \n\"There's an outside risk that British regulatory bodies could try and block the News-BSkyB-BT side of it,\" said another BT analyst.\nOther analysts said the dilution involved, with BT owning nine percent of a 40 percent stake in BSkyB, would assuage regulatory concerns. The likely election of a British Labour government also reduced that risk.\n\"They're banking on (Labour leader) Tony Blair winning government and deregulating cross media rules in the United Kingdom,\" said another Sydney analyst.  \nHowever another analyst pointed to the recent banning by British regulator Oftel of a joint marketing campaign between BT and BSkyB as a sign of the rocky road ahead for News and BT.",

Are you virtual? Where are you really?\"\nPart consumer bank, part software testing site, Security First opened its virtual doors a year ago this month.\nBut now Security First plans to add actual doors, opening small offices in Atlanta, Cambridge, Mass., and Silicon Valley in California.\n\"I think we can more effectively market if we have a physical presence,\" Mahan said in an interview.\nComparing his bank to discount brokerage firm Charles Schwab & Co., Mahan said having the offices may give customers a sense of security, even if they never use an office.\nSecurity First's current location is on the Internet. The bank is one of five in the United States that operates directly on the Internet, according to the Bank Administration Institute.\nFederally insured Security First can be accessed at Website (www.sfnb.com), which brings consumers to a home page that looks like a bank lobby.\nCustomers can reach their account anywhere they have access to the Internet, rather than being tied to a single terminal where they have finance software, like other computer banks.\n\"Our goal was to have a bank that was fully interactive, where an individual could see all his information,\" Mahan said.\nMost Security First customers have a money market account and a demand deposit account. Customers can open a checking account with as little as $100, an amount most choose to start to make sure the bank works, Mahan said.\nCustomers can pay bills electronically, purchase certificates of deposits or acquire a Visa card. Security First is also hoping to offer brokerage products and first and second mortgage products by the end of the year. Funds can be accessed by automatic teller machine, and Security First absorbs interbank fees for using the machines.\nWith limited infrastructure, Security First can offer higher yields, Mahan said. The bank was offering a six-month CD with an annaul percentage yield of 5.9 percent.\nSecurity First was spawned as an idea of Mahan, who was chief executive officer at Kentucky-based Cardinal Bancshares Inc., and his sister-in-law's husband, Michael McChesney, who was starting a security software firm.\n\"He educated me on the Internet for years and years and years,\" Mahan said. Mahan used the charter of one of Cardinal's thrifts, changed its name to Security First and used it to start the Internet bank.\nMcChesney's, firm, SecureWare Inc. developed software that Mahan said has military-grade security. So far, the bank has not had its security breached, Mahan said.\n\"That doesn't mean that there haven't been a number of sophisticated attempts,\" he said. \"If you have enough money and enough time you can break into anything.\"\nOutsiders agree that Security First has shown a record of being secure, avoiding viruses, data theft and other potential dangers of Internet commerce.\n\"They do use a level of security that the Pentagon reserves for its most secure and sensistive systems,\" said Paul Schmeltzer, executive vice president for network services at Southeast Switch Inc., the corporate organisation for the Honour Network, the fourth largest ATM network in the country. \"Is any security design totally foolproof or totally secure? Probably not.\"\nThat software and others developed for the bank is likely to be the prime money maker for Security First. Mahan admits that Five Paces Inc., Security First's software unit, will be the prime contributor to the company's net income.\n\"The bank is really a test site to use as a demonstration for potential customers of the software business,\" said Gary Craft, an analyst who follows the bank for Alexandria, Va..-based Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.\nSecurity First's stock is traded on Nasdaq.\nSecurity First has opened about 5,600 accounts. Most of its customers are male, between the ages of 25 and 45, with average income above $63,000 a year. More than 80 percent own their own home, attractive demographics for marketing.\nSecurity First has also attracted competition. This month, Atlanta Internet Bank opened for business.\nUnlike Security First, Don Shapleigh, chief executive of Atlanta Internet, says he does not plan to open any customer offices. \"I have the WorldNet. I have other ways to get out.\" Federally insured Atlanta Internet currently offers its services to subscribers of AT & T's WorldNet Services.\nShapleigh also argues that Atlanta Internet is the first true Internet only bank, saying that Security First is really a software company.\n\"I'm not selling software,\" he said. \"I'm a banker.\"\nAtlanta Internet, which is a service provided by a unit of Carolina First Corp. can be reached on the Internet at (www.atlantabank.com).",

Sales grew 10.8 percent to $12.04 billion from $10.87 billion.\nThe earnings beat Wall Street forecasts that averaged $1.38 a share, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.\nBut Sears' stock fell $2 to $49.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, mostly on profit-taking.\n\"The stock was up strongly early in the week and I think people are just taking profits,\" Rifkin said.\nAnalysts said Sears gained from its decision to remodel some stores and expand its clothing offerings.\n\"Clearly they're gaining market share and clearly they're doing the right thing and the consumer likes what she sees when she goes into the store,\" said Karen Sack, analyst at the S&P Equity Group.\nOperating income from domestic operations rose 14.8 percent to $531 million in the quarter as revenue rose 11.6 percent to $10.92 billion. Comparable-store sales rose 5.4 percent for the quarter.\nOperating income from domestic operations for all of 1996 rose 20.9 percent to $1.28 billion, while revenues increased 10.2 percent to $34.85 billion.\nGross margins as a percent of merchandise sales rose to 27.9 percent from 26.9 percent in the 1995 period.\nRifkin said margins were not likely to rise as much in 1997 as in the fourth quarter, but said cost-cutting should drive earnings growth this year.\nHe forecast earnings at $3.60 a share in 1997 and $4.25 a share in 1998, up from $3.12 a share in 1996.\nInternational operations, including merchandising and credit operations in Canada and Mexico, earned $36 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $7 million in the 1995 period.\nThe increase in earnings was largely attributable to improved performance at both Sears Canada and Sears Mexico, lower selling and administrative expenses at Sears Mexico, and writeoffs of Sears Canada properties in the year-ago quarter, it said.\nSears, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., operates more than 800 department stores and 2,500 other stores offering clothing, home and automotive products and services.\nWhile earnings rose in the quarter, they fell for the year, in part because 1995 included a gain of $776 million from the former Allstate Corp. subsidiary, which was spun off to Sears' shareholders in June 1995.\nFor all of 1996, Sears earned $1.27 billion, or $3.12 a share, in net profits, down from $1.80 billion, or $4.50 a share, in 1995. Sales grew 9 percent to $38.22 billion from $35.0 billion.",

Also, who wants to come out in this kind of weather?\"\nIn central New York State, where it was also snowing, Konarski said there were lines at malls before stores opened at 7 a.m. EST (1200 GMT), but most shoppers were looking for markdowns on holiday accessories and to return merchandise.\nIn Cleveland, many workers were on vacation and some offices were closed, and shopper traffic at the Tower City Center mall complex was moderate.\n\"We've had a good, strong season,\" said the manager of a women's clothing store who has worked in retailing 11 years. \"Business today is pretty good. Volume is moderate.\"\nAt Tower City's AnnTaylor store, sales associate Mary Rogonjich said Thursday morning traffic was slow but she expected things to pick up during lunch hour.\n\"Things have been steady this morning, and we have not had that many returns,\" she said. \"We've had a very good season -- above plan.\" The store was offering up to 50 percent off on silk blouses, pants, jackets, shoes and other items on Thursday.\nIn Miami, some shops were seeing more traffic.\n\"The store is very busy. Really everything is marked down,\" said a spokeswoman at Federated Department Stores Inc.'s Macy's store in Miami's Falls mall.\nBut analysts said that while promotions picked up before Christmas and would accelerate this week, special discounts were fewer and less steep than last year, which should help retailer profits.\n\"Some retailers did get promotional in the last few days,\" Mullin said. \"I think you'll see it really starting today.\"\nWal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, said in a telephone message for investors on Monday that discount and warehouse sales were at the low end of plan for the holidays in the third week of December.\nThe company is in line for sales increases of 4 percent to 5 percent for November and December, the company said.\nDayton Hudson Corp. said on Tuesday sales were meeting expectations and that the company had planned its inventories well.\nSears, Roebuck and Co. said overall sales and sales at stores open at least a year were showing upper-single digit increases.\n\"Overall sales were strong the last three days before Christmas,\" Vice President of Marketing John Costello said, noting that clothing, tools, jewelry, multimedia computers and tires sold well.",

Thursday reported a big loss for the latest quarter, as its CompuServe online service posted a $58 million loss and became more of a headache to its parent.\nH&R Block had a net loss of $74.1 million, or 71 cents a share, in its second quarter ended Oct. 31, compared with a loss of $8.3 million, or 8 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter. Revenues grew to $253.4 million from $221.0 million.\nKansas City-based H&R Block, the nation's largest tax preparation company, blamed the bad news mainly on losses at its CompuServe unit, the world's second-largest online service, which has failed to sign up new subscribers, especially in the United States.\nH&R Block still owns 80.1 percent of CompuServe, after selling the rest of the stock in April in an initial step to spin off the unit.\nBut plans to complete the spin-off were suspended in August after CompuServe reported poor first-quarter earnings and projected second-quarter losses.\nJust nine months ago, shareholders and analysts were pushing for a spinoff, arguing that CompuServe's value was being held back by H&R Block's staid tax business.\nNow they want a spinoff because the online services provider is weighing on H&R Block's performance.\n\"The business model changed for CompuServe in a fairly dramatic way and now CompuServe's valuation is clearly holding back H&R Block's valuation,\" said Martin Romm, analyst at CS First Boston.\n\"How quickly things change,\" said Dennis Hudson, analyst at George K. Baum. \"What happened was a whole lot of competition came in (to the online market.) The market became saturated before people expected.\"\nAnalysts said H&R Block was waiting for CompuServe's new business strategy announced Thursday -- focusing on the corporate market rather than home users -- to push the unit toward profitability before the spinoff is completed.\nH&R Block also cut its quarterly dividend to 20 cents a share from 32 cents, a move that it had previously said would occur after the spinoff was completed.\n\"Even though the separation has not been completed, the board decided such action was prudent at this time because CompuServe is not adding to the company's profitability,\" said Frank Salizzoni, H&R Block's president and chief executive officer and CompuServe's chairman.\n\"In taking this action today, the board is indicating it anticipates the separation of CompuServe.\"\nBoth Romm and Hudson said they continue to rate H&R Block stock as a buy and stressed that there was nothing wrong with the company's core tax business.\nThe company said its Tax Services unit reported a pretax loss of $42.2 million in the second quarter, up $6.9 million a year ago.\n\"This year's deeper second quarter loss in these core businesses is in large part a result of the company's investments to expand its office network and roll out new products,\" Salizzoni said.\n\"They're making these investments primarily in new stores that are absorbing costs primarily without any commensurate contribution in revenue,\" Romm said, noting that the tax season does not begin until early next year.\nH&R Block stock fell 37.5 cents to $28 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Stonecipher would not comment on any specific mergers or acquisitions.\n\"I don't think Boeing would be on our radar screen,\" he said regarding a possible acquisition. \"We may be on theirs.\"\nStonecipher also said he would be interested in trading McDonnell Douglas commercial aircraft assets for Boeing's military aircraft business, but noted there have been no talks in that area. Boeing said it did not comment on rumours or speculation about mergers and acquisitions.\nAlready the smallest of the three major commercial jet makers, McDonnell said last month it would not continue to compete against Boeing and Europe's Airbus Industrie in the market for the biggest commercial jetliners.\nBritish and U.S. forces have announced plans to buy 3,000 of the new generation fighter jets, with initial delivery scheduled for 2008.\nWith potential export sales of another 2,000 jets and additional funding for development and support, the programme could be worth $200 billion to $500 billion over the coming decades, industry executives said.\nMcDonnell Douglas stock lost $4.25 to $51.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the biggest losers of the day. Boeing rose $1.50 to $93.25 and Lockheed Martin rose $1.875 to $95.625, also on the NYSE.\nJohn Modzelewski, an analyst at PaineWebber, said the decision could force St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas to seek acquisitions more aggressively to help build its business, or into a merger with another defence or aerospace company.\n\"Everything's back on the table,\" Modzelewski said.\nIn the past year, McDonnell Douglas has been the subject of rumoured talks with Boeing, Rockwell International Corp. and Raytheon Co.\n\"This will be something of a wakeup call,\" CS First Boston analyst Peter Aseritis said. \"It's a fairly sharp and dramatic blow to McDonnell Douglas and I would venture to guess one they probably didn't see coming.\"\nPaineWebber's Modzelewski said, \"Without having the internal growth such as joint strike fighter would give them, they're going to have to grow through acquisition.\" That could include Texas Instruments Inc.'s defence electronics business, which is for sale, according to published reports.\n\"Texas Instruments is a very interesting property if in fact it is for sale,\" Stonecipher said in repsonse to a question about the defence electronics business.\nIn a statement to employees Monday, Stonecipher noted the company's backlog of aircraft orders to the military at home and abroad and said it was pursuing other orders. The company has a $46 billion order backlog, a spokesman said.\n\"This decision does not mean we are out of the military aircraft business,\" Stonecipher said.\nMcDonnell currently builds the Air Force F-15 fighter and the Navy-Marine F-18E/F as well as the C-17 military cargo plane. Both the F-15 and the F-18 are to be replaced by the joint strike fighter in the next century.",

        "Text": "The U.S. economy should provide a repeat in 1997 of the steady growth seen in 1996, which should also lead to car and truck sales near 1996 levels, according to economists who work for the Big Three automakers.\nEconomists for Ford Motor Co and General Motors Corp both forecast vehicle sales between 15 million and 15.5 million in 1997, while Chrysler Corp's economist predicted sales of 15.2 million. Sales were about 15.4 million in 1996. The forecasts were made in a presentation to the Society of Automotive Analysts.  \n\"We are likely to see more of the same,\" Chrysler's W. Van Bussmann said, echoing the view of the other two analysts.\n\"We see no significant changes in either direction on fiscal or monetary policy,\" said G. Mustafa Mohatarem of General Motors.\nFord's Martin Zimmerman was even more optimistic. \"I frankly don't see why this growth can't continue into 1998,\" he said.  \nBut that does not mean the auto industry has no concerns. The one short-term worry all three economists voiced was the weakening of the yen, which fell to about 117 to the dollar Monday from about 106 a year ago. A weaker yen makes Japanese imports, including automobiles, less expensive in the United States.\nThat, in turn, makes Japanese cars more competitive in the U.S. market, giving Japanese automakers more flexibility in pricing, analysts said.  \nBut the analysts all expected political or market pressures to cause the yen to stabilize and then strengthen somewhat against the dollar this year.\n\"We should see the yen start to strengthen,\" Zimmerman said.\nBussmann forecast the yen at 106 to the dollar by the end of 1997.\nIn western Europe, analysts see continued economic pressure associated with the move to European union in 1999 continuing to weigh on the economy there and keep vehicle sales about flat.  \nBut Mohatarem argued that there is a possibility for a positive surprise in central Europe, saying Russia could achieve three percent economic growth by 1998.\nMexico was also seen as an area for growth, with that economy recoverying quicker than expected from the recent peso crisis, analysts said.\nMeanwhile, Bussmann argued that capacity usage for truck production will remain at about 80 percent through the year 2000 and that truck demand as a percentage of total vehicle market share will continue to rise.\n\"We see the light truck demand reaching 50 percent (of total vehicle demand) by just past the turn of the century,\" he said.\nBut other analysts were not as optimistic about demand for light trucks, which generally have higher profit margins than cars.\n\"I don't think it will reach 50 percent of demand,\" said Thomas Webb, chief economist with the National Automobile Dealers Association.\nDuring his presentation, Webb also said his forecast for 1997 auto sales was on the low end of a range he defined between 14.7 million and 15.1 million autos.",

It also operates a wholesale mortgage banking business.\nDespite the offer, SFB stock fell after running up sharply in recent days on takeover speculation. Some investors were disappointed the price was not higher, analysts said.\n\"All the people were really speculating yesterday that it was a lot higher are selling today because they're disappointed,\" said Tony Howard, analyst at Olde Discount Corp.\nSFB stock lost $1.625 to $56.375 in active trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nStandard Federal chief lending officer Garry Carley said at a news conference that ABN AMRO had made the highest bid for the bank among several serious suitors.\n\"We had others who expressed strong interest in the bank,\" Carley told reporters.\nABN AMRO, the Netherlands' leading bank, said it would issue $750 million in preferred stock to help fund the acquisition, its biggest to date. It said it would issue the shares through a U.S. subsidiary, ABN AMRO North America Inc.\nFormed in a 1990 merger, ABN AMRO already is the biggest foreign bank in the United States. Its LaSalle group has 130 branches and 7,750 staff members, mainly in the Chicago area.\nThe agreement marks ABN AMRO North America Inc.'s sixth acquisition in three years and is likely to be the last for a while, ABN AMRO North America Chief Executive Officer Harrison Tempest said at a news conference.\n\"We're out of the acquisition business for some time now,\" Tempest said. When asked how long before it might make another deal, he said, \"probably two years.\"\nThe combined banks will also be the eighth largest mortgage originator in the United States, ABN AMRO said.\n\"It gets us into the league we want to be in mortgage servicing and mortgage origination,\" Tempest said.\nSFB employs about 4,000 people and serves 1 million clients in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana.\nABN AMRO said Standard Federal's banks will continue to operate under the Standard Federal name and there would be \"significant cost savings\" following the deal.\nWhile saying no jobs would be cut initially, both companies said some job cuts were likely eventually as administrative functions and some branches were consolidated.\nWith Standard Federal, ABN AMRO North America will have the second largest deposit base in the Chicago market.\nAnalysts said recent changes in U.S. banking law that will level the playing field between thrifts and banks should help speed other acquisitions of savings and loans.\n\"I think you're going to see an increased level of activity, both in banks acquiring thrifts and thrifts acquiring thrifts,\" said Jonathon gray, analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Co.\nABN AMRO said it had reached agreement with Standard Federal's board, but the deal still needed the approval of its shareholders and supervisory authorities.\nThe acquisition was expected to be completed by mid-1997, ABN said, adding that the deal would contribute to its earnings.",

Overall, the bank reported return on equity of 16.9 percent in the first nine months of 1996.\nNow the corporate and institutional banking unit is being reshaped, paring back business lines to focus on those central to customer relationships.  \n\"I firmly believe that something that's chugging along at eight or nine percent can in fact be improved and we fully expect to get it up to that 15 percent or better return\" on equity, Istock said.\nStockholders and analysts appear to accept Istock's argument that the corporate bank's results can only go up.\n\"You can criticize them, but frankly, it can only improve,\" said Joseph Duwan, analyst at Keefe Bruette & Woods. \"I think they're taking a hard look at the businesses they're in in corproate banking.\"  \nIstock stressed that increased revenue will come from the corporate bank by focusing on areas that will grow and cutting unprofitable areas.\nAlready this year, the bank has said it will exit the institutional custody and master trust businesses, two paperwork-intensive lines that would have required major investment to gain significant market share.\nIstock also said the bank was trimming its trading operations, again focusing on instruments customers need.  \n\"I don't think we will have to have the entire (trading) product line or be on the edge of the envelope,\" Istock said. But he added that the types of trading vehicles customers need change.\nIstock said he was aware of the corporate bank's troubled performance before First Chicago Corp and NBD Bancorp merged a year ago, forming what is now the ninth largest bank holding company in the United States with assets of $106.7 billion.\nMeanwhile, First Chicago's stock hit a post merger high last week, before sliding in a sell off of most bank stocks this week. An aggressive 40 million share stock repurchase plan announced in October has helped boost the stock.\nBut another area of concern to analysts is credit card chargeoffs, which jumped earlier this year.\nIstock said while chargeoffs will likely rise more as the economy slows, the business will continue to be a strong earner for First Chicago.\n\"It's a business we know, we understand and we plan to stay in,\" Istock said. He added that the bank is beginning to use its 13-million-customer credit card database to sell other products to credit card holders.\nFirst Chicago shares were up 1/8 at 55 Friday.",

        "Text": "Aiming to fill Americans' seemingly insatiable desire for sport utility vehicles, Chrysler Corp.  and Ford Motor Co.  both introduced new models of the go-anywhere vehicles Tuesday at the North American International Auto Show.\nThe plush Lincoln Navigator and the brawny Dodge Durango were introduced a day after General Motors Corp.'s unit unveiled an upscale version of its popular Yukon sport/utility vehicle and Subaru of America Inc., a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd  7270T, debuted a new sport/utility based on a passenger car chassis.\nSport/utility vehicles sales climbed to just over two million in the United States in 1996 and are the fastest-growing automotive segment.\nThe vehicles are so popular that even sportscar maker Porsche AG said Tuesday it also plans to enter the market by the turn of the century.\nAlthough more and more companies are adding more and more models, the market is yet to be saturated, as more drivers foresake cars for the larger vehicles.\n\"They really are considered substitutes,\" said Diane Swonk, deputy chief economist at First Chicago NBD Corp. \"These are replacing old station wagons. They're also eating very heavily into the luxury car markets.\"\nLuxury is a key feature of the new Ford and GM models.\nFord's Lincoln Navigator, which is expected to be available in July, includes leather seating surfaces, walnut wood accents and second row bucket seats.\nIt is expected to be priced in the mid-$40,000 range and will compete at the premium end of the market with vehicles by Lexus and Land Rover. It is aimed at affluent empty nesters or high-profile active families. The target age for Navigator owners is 45-55, said Jim O'Connor, general manager of Ford's Lincoln Mercury division.\nThe vehicle, which O'Connor expects will sell 20,000 annually, was driven through a mock rock wall and waterfall to make its debut.\nThe vehicle seats eight, has a 5.4-litre V8 engine with 8,000 pound towing capacity and 116.4 cubic feet of cargo space.\nGMC's Yukon Denali, which is scheduled to be in production in  the 1998 calendar year, features four heated seats and a premium sound system, among other accessories.\n\"We're certainly going upscale,\" Roy Roberts, general manager of GM's Pontiac-GMC division, said when asked about pricing. He declined to comment further.\nChrysler made its typical auto show splash with the introduction of the Dodge Durango, which broke through the floor of a mock-up of the automaker's new headquarters building.\nTouting it as a breakthrough vehicle that offers \"more of everything,\" Chrysler said sales could eventually reach 200,000 units. The automaker invested $910 million to bring the vehicle to market.\nThe Durango, which goes on sale in December, uses the same chassis and beefy front end as the Dodge Dakota pickup truck. It is aimed at a more downscale audience than Chrysler's tony Jeep Grand Cherokee. One unique feature is a rear cargo well sized to fit a hunting rifle.\nThe vehicle is bigger than Ford's popular Explorer, but smaller than the Yukon, Navigator and Ford Expedition.\nDurango features an optional third bench seat, boosting its seating capacity up to eight people.\nDespite growing criticism about sport/utilities' poor fuel economy, the Durango offers the biggest engines in its class, including 5.2-litre and 5.9-litre V8s.\nPricing was not announced, but Chrysler Vice Chairman Robert Lutz said the Durango could be made with a four-cylinder engine, if necessary.\nWith so many new sport/utility vehicles entering the market, it is becoming more competitive, which will eventually lead to pressure on margins.\n\"We'll get saturation if people can't afford to buy these things, relative to the cars they drive,\" said Joseph Phillippi, analyst at Lehman Brothers.\nDemand for more affordable sport/utilities will push manufacturers to build them on car platforms, as Subaru, Toyota and Honda are doing, Phillippi said, adding that few drivers travel far off road and don't need the ruggedness and high ground clearance of a truck-based sport/utility.\nExecutives at the Big Three automakers stress that their new sport/utility vehicles will not compete with existing lines.\n\"We don't think this will be a major drag at all on Expedition,\" O'Connor said of Ford's current top-of-the-line sport utility vehicle. Instead, he said the Navigator should attract new customers to Lincoln-Mercury.\n\"I think it will bring a whole new customer to Lincoln,\" he said.\nBut the automakers also know that if they don't offer sport/utility vehicles in a variety of niches, others will.\n\"I'd rather have the alternative be in my dealer\" showroom, said Chrysler's Lutz.\nAs for Porsche, Chairman Wendelin Wiedeking would not go into specifics on the German automaker's plans in the sector, other than to say it was in discussions with a third party.",

He would not comment on other possible acquisition targets.  \nIstock also reiterated that an acquisition could be made outside of traditional banking as regulatory lines between banking other financial businesses are erased.\nInsurance, investment banking and securities banking are all areas that could be targets of traditional banks, he said.\n\"We're willing to consider any alternative that we think makes sense for our shareholders first of all and also for enhancing our customer relationships,\" Istock said.\nAnalysts see First Chicago as having excess capital on its books, which weighs on a bank's performance. EVEREN Securities analyst Thomas Maier said the bank could have more than $2 billion in excess capital, while others estimate a lower amount.\nAn aggressive 40-million-share stock repurchase plan has helped allay analysts' and investors' concerns about the excess capital. But making a purchase could also put capital to work.\n\"It's a way of in fact buying your stock back without having to go out in the market to do it,\" Maier said.\nFirst Chicago shares were up 5/8 at 55-1/2 Friday.",

        "Text": "Firstar Corp's announcement on Thursday that it expected to fall short of analysts' fourth-quarter earnings estimates for what it believes are temporary factors includes one element -- a continued modest decline in commercial loans outstanding -- that could be a more lasting concern, analysts said.\nThe Milwaukee-based bank holding company, which has $19.9 billion in assets, said it expects fourth quarter earnings of about $0.95 a share excluding any one-time gains, $0.08 short of the consensus and unchanged from a year ago.  \nFirstar is in the midst of a program to trim costs and enhance revenues and said factors including the implementation of that program and assimilation of recent acquisitions would hurt earnings. But the bank also said continued declines in its commercial loans outstanding would also hinder earnings, and was a temporary factor.\n\"I think while that sounds plausible, it also remains to be proven,\" said Ben Crabtree, banking analyst at Dain Bosworth. Crabtree had forecast earnings of $1.08 a share for the quarter.  \nWhile expenses from the restructuring and acquisitions should eventually be eliminated, analysts were not as sure that the loss of loans would be reversed.\n\"The question going forward, and that's an unanswerable question, is the long-term impact on the revenue side,\" said Thomas Maier, banking analyst at EVEREN Securities.\nFirstar investor relations spokesman Joe Messinger said the decline in loans outstanding is due mostly to the focus on the restructuring during the first two quarters of the year.  \nFirstar also said credit card charge-offs will remain higher than the company's historic levels in the quarter, though they will be in line with the industry overall.\n\"It's something they've indicated in the past,\" Maier said, adding that higher charge-offs were already built into his previous $1.05 a share estimate on fourth quarter earnings and outperform rating on the stock.\nIn the 10-Q filing with the SEC for the third quarter, Firstar said it expected credit card charge-offs to rise to 4.5-5.0 percent in the fourth and first quarters, before declining to 4-4.5 percent. Charge-offs were 4.06 percent in the third quarter.\nIf Firstar meets its $0.95 a share estimate for the quarter, 1996 earnings would be $3.34 a share, compared to $3.00 a share a year ago.\nFirstar shares fell one to 51 Thursday amid a downturn in banking stocks.",

In its statement on Wednesday, Mercury said it fired Doyle.\nFiled in federal court in Chicago on Wednesday, the lawsuit alleges the company and some senior officers misrepresented or omitted crucial information about Mercury's earnings for the last three years, lawyers who filed the suit said in a statement.\nThe lawsuit also said Doyle had sold tens of thousands and Chairman John Brincat hundreds of thousands of shares of Mercury stock at inflated prices, netting millions of dollars in illegal profits.\nBrincat was not available for comment. A company spokesman declined to comment. Attempts to locate Doyle were not successful.\nThe finance company said on Wednesday its 1996 earnings would be restated to $56.7 million from $120.7 million and that earnings for the three prior years would also adjusted downward, though not as sharply.\nThe problems appeared to stem from unauthorised entries in financial records by its chief accounting officer, Doyle, the company said.\nIt also said it was in violation of certain provisions if its loan agreements and that a special committee of directors has been formed to investigate the problems.\nAnalysts were hesitant to talk about Mercury, saying they did not have much information.\nBut they did say the company's planned acquisition of Fidelity Acceptance from BankBoston Corp. was unlikely to be completed. The deal, announced on Jan. 10, called for Mercury to issue about $458 million in stock to BankBoston. BankBoston said on Wednesday it was awaiting an audit of Mercury.\n\"I think the odds are very high that the deal will not go through,\" one analyst said, who asked not to be identified.\nAnalysts also said Mercury has not been as forthcoming as other consumer finance companies when providing detailed financial information.\nMercury helped pioneer the business of lending to consumers whose credit was less than perfect. It started making loans to people in the military and has grown into one of the country's largest lenders in the used-car market.\n\"They haven't been quite as open as any others in the industry have been,\" one analyst said.\nTwo brokerage firms cut ratings on Mercury Thursday.\nGruntal & Co. said it suspended its rating, adding, \"We recommend that holders exit positions as soon as possible.\"\nPiper Jaffray cut its rating to market performer from buy and in a research report said, \"Our guess is most of the over recognised income came from (Mercury's) insurance subsidiary.\"",

A finance company without a source of funds is like a retailer without a source of merchandise, analysts noted.\n\"If you can't fund, you're out of business,\" one equity analyst that follows the company said, requesting anonymity.\nSome rating agencies, including Standard & Poor's Corp, lowered Mercury's commercial paper to a default rating Friday.\n\"They're very close to some reorganization, bankruptcy filing, probably a voluntary reorganization,\" said Thomas Kmiotek, analyst at Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co.\nHe and other analysts noted the company has another $100 million in commercial paper due Thursday, February 6.\nA Mercury  spokesman did not return repeated calls seeking comment on the company's financing Friday afternoon.\nAside from the company's current inability to sell debt, Mercury is also facing a host of shareholder lawsuits, filed after the company said it had to restate its net income over the past four years by a total of about $90 million because of accounting irregularities.\nLawsuits do not become a financial liability for the company unless there is a judgment in favor of the shareholders. However, the company's admission of misstatements makes it easier for the sharheolders to prove their case, leaving only the questions of who would have to pay how much, one securities lawyer said.\n\"Securities laws are very, very simple,\" said Ted Koenig, a partner with Chicago-based lawfirm Holleb & Coff \"If there is an ommission or misstatement of a material fact... there's liabiltiy.\"\nAlso, the company's market capitalization plunged by about $2.2 billion Friday, based on the 13 point fall of Mercury's shares and the 172 million shares the company said it had outstanding late last year. That reduces the equity cushion the company has available to show its creditors, Koenig said.\nBut analysts also said the company had about $1 billion in loans receivable on its books at the end of October, 1996 -- an asset to show creditors.\n\"No one has questioned the validity of the amount of receivables they have on their books or the quality of those receivables,\" Kmiotek said.\nAlso, Mercury has generally been well regarded in the sub-prime credit quality loan business, which could help it negotiate with its banks and continue as a going concern, said analysts and lawyers familiar with the company.\nMercury said in a statement it is in discussions with its lenders to satisfy working capital needs, but that it could not predict the outcome of those discussions.",

All but one of its nine clubs will lose money, due to small crowds and cash bailouts to keep teams in Ottawa, Montreal and Vancouver afloat during the 1996 season.\nThe 120-year-old Ottawa Rough Riders franchise folded earlier this month at the end of the regular season.\nSo precarious are the league's finances that the cash-strapped Eskimos could not afford to fly players' wives to the Grey Cup game in Hamilton, Ontario, 42 miles (68 km) southwest of Toronto.\n\"The LAST Grey Cup?\" asked the Toronto Star, Canada's biggest newspaper, in a front page story on Friday.\nSome say the CFL needs the bigger and richer National Football League to survive.\nCFL Commissioner Larry Smith said he is interested in \"building a relationship\" with the NFL, but that the CFL will not become a Triple A minor league.\n\"I have no interest in a farm system. If we could have some developmental relationships like we've done in the past with guys like Warren Moon and Joe Theismann, then that would be great,\" Smith said in a telephone interview.\nMoon and Theismann were star CFL quarterbacks in the 1970s and 1980s before jumping to the NFL.\n\"What we have been doing is exploring some ideas on ways we could possibly work together. But we have not reached an agreement on anything at this point,\" said Greg Aiello, director of communications for the NFL.\nCFL purists fear closer ties with the NFL would threaten the distinctiveness of Canadian-style football.\nCanada's game closely resembles the U.S. brand, but there are a few key differences. The playing field is longer and wider. Canadian teams get only three downs instead of four to gain 10 yards and keep possession of the ball.\nThere are 12 players a side compared to 11, and single points are awarded for missed field goals not run out of the end zone.\nFootball writer and former CFL player Frank Cosentino said the NFL could help pay the salaries of developing players, but that closer ties could alienate the CFL's remaining followers.\nBut fans already appear to have turned off the CFL.\nAverage attendance slipped to 22,095 this year from 24,400 in 1995, despite a slick new \"Radically Canadian\" marketing campaign trumpeting the league's Canadian heritage.\nIn major markets such as Toronto and Vancouver, the league is considered second-rate.\nA 1995 pre-season NFL game between the Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills in Toronto drew about 60,000 fans. This year, the Argonauts, despite the league's best record of 15-3, averaged just 20,400 fans.\nUnless there is a late surge in ticket sales, the Grey Cup game will fall short of a sell-out. \"The way it looks now we may have about 36,000. We have capacity for about 40,000,\" organiser Matthew Moreland said on Friday.\nIt is a far cry from the 1950s and 1960s when the CFL attracted huge crowds and players such as Ron Lancaster, Joe Kapp, Angelo Mosca and Sam Etcheverry were household names.\nPlayers now rarely stay long enough to become known by fans. Poor marketing has also left the CFL far behind other sports in the race for the public's entertainment dollars.\nIn a bid to save the league, Smith has proposed a restructuring plan to cut costs. All clubs have until January to secure enough season-ticket sales to operate next year.\nSmith is confident there will be eight teams next year, but he said the CFL was prepared to operate with fewer.\nThere will likely be no football in Ottawa, next year after the league revoked the franchise in Canada's capital from Chicago businessman Horn Chen.",

This won't be the last,\" said Fred Ketchen, senior vice-president and director of equity trading for ScotiaMcLeod Inc, a unit of Bank of Nova Scotia.\nToronto's record-setting run was led by banking, communications, conglomerates and technology issues.

        "Text": "Toronto stocks soared to new heights on Wednesday, powered by a rally in bank shares as foreign investors stampeded into Canada's financial markets, lured by falling interest rates and a recovering Canadian economy.\nShares in Canada's big six banks hit 52-week highs on the Toronto Stock Exchange, propelling the country's biggest stock market to its 53rd record close of 1996.\nThe Canadian dollar has also surged this week, hitting its strongest level since October 30, 1995.\nDeclining interest rates, low inflation and falling budget deficits have combined to make Canada the flavor of the month, economists said.\n\"Overall, foreign investors have just become enamored with Canada as a place for investment,\" Michael Gregory, an economist with Lehman Brothers, said in a telephone interview.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange jumped 85 points to close around 5749, fueled by brisk action in interest-rate sensitive issues such as banks and utilities.\nThe key 300 Index has gained more than 20 percent this year, compared to about 19 percent for the Dow Jones Average and 16 percent for the Standard & Poors 500.\nThe Bank of Canada is expected to ease interest rates again as early as this week. The central bank has cut rates 19 times since May 1995 in a bid to revive a sluggish economy.\nBank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen said on Wednesday that Canada's improving economy gives the central bank more latitude to set Canadian rates independent of U.S. rates.\nHe added Canada is now in a better position to withstand a hike in U.S. rates than it has been in recent years.\n\"The economic outlook is favorable. We will soon see signs of the payoff for the difficult restructuring decisions taken in both the private and public sectors,\" Thiessen said.\nAfter several years of belt tightening, Canadian governments have either balanced their budgets or are on track to wipe out huge deficits.\nCanada's 1.2 percent inflation rate is one of the lowest in the world and less than half the U.S. rate.\nSeveral Canadian banks cut residential mortgage rates on Wednesday to levels not seen in about three decades.\nGregory said he expected Canada to continue to outperform the United States on the rate front and that offshore investors recognized that. \"I think investors are coming to terms with the fact that Canadian interest rates -- because of low inflation and improving currency prospects -- should be below U.S. rates,\" he said.\n\"Many investors are jumping on that and the Canadian dollar is undervalued. It's cheap,\" Gregory said.\nThe Canadian currency closed around C$1.3312 (US$0.7512) on Wednesday after trading around C$1.3300 earlier in the session. The dollar broke through C$1.3300 on Tuesday, its strongest level since October 1995.\nIn stocks, the country's big six banks have been big beneficiaries of favorable interest rates and the overseas scramble to buy Canadian stocks.\nThe TSE's financial services group jumped 2.5 percent on Wednesday after soaring three percent on Tuesday. The sector has gained nearly 1,400 points since September.\nDeclining interest rates make bank lending more profitable and bank dividends more attractive for investors.\nSoaring bank profits have also lured investors. The major banks report their year-end results in a few weeks and are on track for a third straight year of record profits.\nRecent listings on the New York Stock Exchange have given Canadian banks a higher profile in the United States where they are considered cheap compared to U.S. bank stocks.\nNew York-based Morgan Stanley issued a bullish recommendation on two Canadian banks on Tuesday and predicted a strong fourth quarter for the entire group.",

It was the third Canadian bank to raise its dividend recently.\nRoyal Bank was the fourth of Canada's Big Six banks to post a third straight year of record profits.\nResults from Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada, which are due on Thursday, were expected to push the group's earnings past the C$6 billion level ($4.4 billion), up from last year's record C$5.2 billion ($3.8 billion).\n\"We're announcing strong results ... and this dividend increase is evidence of our commitment to rewarding shareholders and enhancing shareholder value,\" Royal Bank Chairman John Cleghorn said in a statement.\nHigher asset volumes, lower credit losses and strong performances from wealth management and investment banking fattened Royal Bank's bottom line.\nThe bank's brokerage arm, RBC Dominion Securities Ltd., turned in a record year due to strong financial markets.\nRoyal Bank's credit quality also continued to improve. The provision for credit losses fell C$140 million ($103 million) to C$440 million ($325 million) in 1996 and was expected to fall more in 1997.\nRoyal Bank continues to seek an acquisition in the United States, but soaring stock prices have made it very expensive.\n\"Indeed in some sectors of wealth management, some of the asking prices have gone right out of sight,\" Cleghorn told reporters during a conference call.\nRoyal Bank's fourth-quarter earnings were slightly better than analysts' estimates.\nEarnings rose to C$1.09 (80 cents) a share in the quarter from C90 cents (66 cents) in the same period in 1995. The consensus forecast from analysts was about C$1.04 (77 cents) a share.\nRoyal Bank's dividend increase surprised some analysts who expected the bank to wait until early next year.\nThe bank is in the middle of a massive share buyback that analysts said had become expensive due to the recent surge in Canadian bank stocks.\n\"It (the dividend hike) is rather surprising. Maybe they won't be going as far with the buyback and this is compensation,\" said Roy Palmer, a banking analyst with investment dealer TD Securities Inc.\nBut Cleghorn said the bank will continue with its buyback of up to 10 percent of its common stock.\n\"We have not indicated any upside price to analysts or the press and we are continuing with our buyback programme,\" he told reporters.\nDespite the strong results, Royal Bank's stock fell along with a sagging Toronto Stock Exchange Wednesday. The bank's shares closed down C65 cents (48 cents) to C$48.25 ($35.68).\nIn New York, Royal Bank's stock fell 62.5 cents to close at $35.625.",

Canada's brokerage industry is dominated by subsidiaries of the countries major banks.\nThe banks are also expected to benefit from lower loan losses as the industry continues to rebound from disastrous loans in commercial real estate, which collapsed in the late 1980's.\nDespite the correction in stocks earlier this summer, bank stocks have remained strong performers. Lower Canadian interest rates have helped push bank stock prices to all-time highs on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\"I think that if the combination of strong profitability couples up with lower interest rates, then it probably will set the backdrop for higher share prices,\" said Susan Cohen, an analyst with Deacon Capital Corp.\nAnalysts said they do not expect any of the banks to raise their dividends during the reporting period.\nBut the string of record bank profits are expected to yield dividend hikes at the end of the fiscal year.\nThe big banks are on track for a third straight year of record annual profits. The group rang up a combined profit of C$5.17 billion in fiscal 1995 ended Oct. 31, up from C$4.25 billion a year earlier.\nAs for 1997, Palmer said he expects a modest increase in profits.\n\"Investment banking is a cyclical business. It may tail off a bit, but there is no sign of a recession yet, so I would think we could get modestly higher earnings next year,\" he said.\nBank of Montreal is expected to report a third-quarter profit of 97 cents Canadian (70.8 cents) per share, up from 93 cents Canadian (67.9 cents) per share a year ago, according to figures supplied by the International Brokers Estimates Service.\nScotiabank's earnings are seen climbing to C$1 (73 cents) per share in the third quarter, up from 86 cents Canadian (62.8 cents) a share.\nToronto-Dominion Bank is expected to post a 72 cents Canadian (52.5 cents) per share profit, up slightly from 71 cents Canadian (51.8 cents) per share in the third quarter of 1995.\nNational Bank's third quarter earnings are forecast to rise to 41 cents Canadian (29.9 cents) per share from 33 cents (24.1 cents) Canadian a share a year earlier.\nCIBC's third quarter results are pegged at C$1.42 ($1.04) a share compared to last year's C$1.13 ($82 cents) per share.\nRoyal Bank of Canada is seen improving to 96 cents Canadian (70 cents) a share in the third quarter, up from 88 cents Canadian (64.2 cents) per share a year earlier.",

        "Text": "A furry hedgehog, idyllic sunsets and the meaner streets of Budapest seem unlikely moneyspinners, but such images are crowding Canada's airwaves as the annual mutual fund season kicks into gear.\nArmed with high-powered ad campaigns, eager fund sellers are vying for the billions of dollars Canadians will pour into registered retirement savings plans (RRSPs).\nWith interest rates at 40-year lows and stocks at stratospheric heights, investors are expected to shun interest-bearing investments for higher yielding mutual funds before the March 1 deadline for RRSP contributions.\n\"We're in the thick of it right now and it's going to get busier and busier toward the end of the (RRSP) season,\" said John Wiltshire, vice-president of marketing for Investors Group, Canada's top fund company with C$25 billion ($18 billion) in assets.\nTAX BENEFIT IS A DRAW\nCanada introduced RRSPs in the late 1950s to allow people without registered pension plans to save for retirement. Investors can deduct the amount from their taxes for the previous year's income.\nBesides being a tax benefit, RRSPs have become more popular as traditional pension benefits are scaled back.\nCanadians have more than C$211 billion ($156 billion) stashed in mutual funds, an eight-fold increase from 1990. An estimated C$23 billion ($17 billion) will be added to the pot this year.\nFund companies also expect a big chunk of the C$250 billion ($186 billion) currently invested in guaranteed investment certificates and term deposits to shift into funds.\nIn what has become an annual rite of the Canadian winter, fund sellers flood the airwaves with promotions, hype and gimmicks to lure RRSP dollars. But, unlike the United States, Canadian broadcast rules prohibit companies from making performance claims on television or radio.\n\"That's why you get fuzzy advertising. They talk about lifestyle and emphasise branding,\" said John Kaszel, director of research for Investment Funds Institute of Canada, a lobby group representing 40 fund companies.\nSoft-sell ads feature happy people in tranquil settings with simple messages such as \"We're here to get you there,\" or \"quietly creating wealth.\"\nNEXT GENERATION THE TARGET\nSome firms are targeting the next generation of investors. GT Global, a member of Liechtenstein Global Trust, launched a Kid's Kit in December to teach youngsters about mutual funds.\nWhen a parent opens a minimum C$500 ($370) account, his child gets a stuffed \"Henry the Hedgehog\" toy, a certificate and a colourful book explaining \"Henry's Mysterious Gift.\"\n\"This is a chance to give a gift to your kids that is tangible and gets them into the habit of investing,\" said CT Global President Joe Canavan.\nOther ads feature smartly tailored people using words such as \"discipline\" and \"performance\" to trumpet their firm's investment strategy.\nSpectrum United Mutual Funds' gritty commercials highlight its team of tough global fund managers, including one who scored a big success investing in a Budapest security company.\nTo add levity to the RRSP season, Bank of Montreal's campaign pricked the balloons of so-called \"experts\", but there was little information on the bank's own funds.\nCritics complain that Canada's advertising rules insult investors' intelligence.\n\"Mutual fund regulators are convinced that mutual fund investors are ignorant dolts who need to be protected from themselves and the industry. The result, as far as radio and television are concerned, is a multimillion dollar river of non-information,\" Toronto Globe and Mail columnist Terence Corcoran wrote recently.\nSCANDALS MAY MEAN TIGHTER CONTROLS\nBut regulators are unlikely to relax their grip on the industry. In fact, the rules could tighten after recent scandals such as the Veronika Hirsch affair.\nHirsch was a star stock picker hired last summer to spearhead Boston-based Fidelity Investments' drive to dominate the Canadian market. But she was removed from her portfolio in November amid a controversy over personal trades she made before joining the world's biggest mutual fund company.\nFidelity also offered clients their money back without penalty. \"We were pleased that the number of people who did take advantage of it was less than our expectation,\" said spokesman Chethan Lakshman, but he did not give any numbers.\nHirsch's True North Equity Fund is now under a less flamboyant manager and has accumulated C$211 million ($156 million) in assets since its launch last September.\nHirsch's status was under discussion, Lakshman said, but a separation package was rumoured to be under negotiation.\nFALLOUT PROMPTS GUIDELINES REVIEW\nThe fallout from the Hirsch affair prompted a review of the industry's guidlines for fund managers. \"It has opened up some concerns, but those are being addressed. Now we are seeing whether more should be done,\" Kaszel said.\nWhile analysts said it was difficult to assess the damage to the industry's credibility, the Hirsch affair changed how companies sell their product.\nBrash campaigns built around high-profile stock pickers are out and the \"team\" is in, analysts said.\nCanada's Big Six banks are also heavy advertisers this year as they strive to become bigger players in a industry dominated by independents.\nThree banks are now among the top 10 firms, with Royal Bank of Canada number three behind Investors Group amd Trimark Investment Management Inc.\nThe banks were allowed to enter the mutual fund business in 1987 and now account for 29 percent of the industry's assets. Fund management fees have helped propel bank profits to record highs in recent years.",

City officials said transit services would resume early Saturday.\nBut picketers did not disrupt commuter trains from Toronto's bedroom communities or interrupt service at Pearson Airport, the country's busiest. Instead of the traffic jams on the city expressways which had been expected, \"It was like a Sunday afternoon,\" one city official said.\nToronto police said there were no major acts of violence, though a few people were arrested, mostly for misconduct.\nThe so-called Days of Protest was organised by labour unions to protest deep budget cuts by Ontario's Conservative government affecting many of this city of 2.2 million people.\nSome critics said the protest did not succeed.\n\"Today's protest was a flop. Yes. They inconvenienced a lot of people, but they failed to shut down the city,\" said Colin Brown of Ontarians for Responsible Government, a right-wing lobby group.\n\"Hundreds of thousands of people didn't come to work and that is what counts,\" said Aleda O'Connor, a spokeswoman for the organisers.\nIronically, the labour unrest came after Fortune magazine called Toronto the city with the world's best quality of life.\nMost of the protests were peaceful, but hundreds of demonstrators tried to smash into the Toronto Stock Exchange, a symbol of the business community that has supported the government's tough fiscal policies.\nProtesters chanted, \"Shut it down, shut it down,\" as they pounded on the glass doors of Canada's biggest stock market. One man wearing a mask and combat fatigues was seen hurling himself against the doors.\nRiot police were moved into the vicinity of stock exchange, but did not intervene. Rally organisers later moved the raucous group away from the doors of the exchange.\n\"We've come to the place where the real power is ... They get their power and strength from inside this building,\" Jim Stanford, an economist for the Canadian Auto Workers, told hundreds of protesters outside the exchange.\nIn the days leading up to the protest, a siege mentality gripped Toronto's Bay Street, the heart of Canada's financial community.\nAt least one brokerage firm flew traders to its offices in New York and Montreal, while other brokers slept in hotel rooms or in their offices overnight.\nOther companies, including the Globe and Mail newspaper, hired boats to ferry employees across Lake Ontario from nearby communities.\nThe demonstrators expressed fury at Ontario Premier Mike Harris' plans to cut spending by C$8 billion ($5.9 billion) to wipe out a big budget deficit by the turn of the century.\nSince coming to power in 1995 on the promise of a right-wing revolution in Canada's most populous province, the Conservatives have revamped labour laws, slashed welfare payments and required recipients to work, and announced plans to close hospitals and cut education budgets.\n\"These cuts that Harris made are hurting the workers. This is part of the polarisation that is happening in Ontario. The anger is going to grow and grow,\" Syd Ryan, president of the Ontario division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, told picketers outside a government building.\nHarris, who has been dubbed \"Newt of the North\" in reference to Republican U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, has vowed the protests will not stall his \"Common Sense Revolution.\"\n\"Will they discourage us from creating more jobs? No. Discourage us from workfare? No. That's what we were elected to do and I don't expect that most of the public want us to change from that agenda,\" Harris told reporters.\nThe Conservatives, who hold their annual convention in Toronto this weekend, have seen their popularity hold at about 50 percent in recent opinion polls.\nMany commuters took the delays in stride.\n\"I see the protesters have a point, but I think it's going to inconvenience a lot of people who don't have any other choice,\" said John Ivarey.\nPolice said one man was charged with a weapons offence after allegedly threatening picketers with a baseball bat and five protesters were charged with public mischief.\nSeveral major manufacturers cancelled day shifts. De Havilland Inc., a unit of transportation firm Bombardier Inc., said 6,200 employees at its Toronto aircraft plant would be off the job Friday.\nOther companies that closed Toronto operations included school bus operator Laidlaw Transit Inc., auto parts firm A.G. Simpson Co. Ltd., and candy maker Nestle Canada Inc.",

The TV spot shows children running down country roads and across lush fields as a choir sings Dylan's song.\nThe commercial ends with a Bank of Montreal logo and the promise of a big announcement on Oct. 16.\nThe new campaign has drawn fire from Dylan fans angry that a big institution has co-opted this protest song from their youth. But a senior bank official said Dylan's lyrics reflect the bank's desire to change in the 1990s.\n\"Our view is a bank has to change because the times are changing. We thought the lyrics caught rather nicely the imperative for large institutions, like banks, that they face having to change,\" George Bothwell, senior vice-president of public affairs, said in a telephone interview.\nSome callers to a morning radio show in Toronto were outraged at the ad campaign. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. played the commercial and Dylan's version, then asked listeners for their reaction.\n\"I was appalled. The bank failed to understand the spirit of the song. It has so many associations for people our age. I hope they reconsider. They went over the line with this one,\" one female caller said.\nAnother listener said: \"Bob Dylan, I can only say, shame on you.\"\nDylan still owns the copyright to the song but was unavailable for comment.\nSome younger callers said aging baby boomers have only themselves to blame.\n\"I don't know why you're surprised. You had high ideals when you grew up. Then you started making money and buying cars. And all the ideals are no longer convenient so you sold out. Every single one of you. Dylan is just doing what everyone is doing,\" a young listener said.\nAnother caller scoffed at the controversy: \"Baby boomers spare us the crocodile tears. A lot of people have sold out.\"\nOne listener found it ironic that in these tough economic times a bank would use a song that warned: \"You better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone.\"\nCanada's big banks, which are on track for a third straight year of record profits, have been criticized for high service fees and tight lending policies.",

The utility previously forecast net income of between C$600 million ($440 million) and C$625 million ($460 million).\n\"These decisions are driven by our determination to improve nuclear performance and to make capital and policy decisions that enable us to succeed in the business environment we face,\" said Ontario Hydro Chief Executive Officer Allan Kupcis.\nHe said the move will not affect Hydro's ability to pay down its debt, estimated at more than C$30 billion ($22 billion) due to overexpansion.\nOntario Hydro is the continent's largest electricity producer based on installed generating capacity and one of the world's biggest non-sovereign borrowers.\nIt operates 96 hydro-electric stations, five nuclear plants and six fossil-fuel stations.\nBut competitive pressures from within and outside Ontario have forced changes on Hydro in recent years.\nLast June, a government commission recommended that Ontario Hydro lose its 90-year power monopoly and face competition from private Canadian power suppliers and U.S.-based competitors.\nAmong the operating decisions made Tuesday, the utility said it will scale back or cancel some projects. The biggest single charge was a C$1.2 billion ($882 million) writedown reflecting the costs of surplus heavy water at its nuclear operations.\nThe decisions will not affect employee staffing levels at the utility.",

They get their power and strength from inside this building,\" Jim Stanford, an economist for the Canadian Auto Workers, told hundreds of protesters outside the exchange.\nDemonstrators chanted \"Shut it down, shut it down,\" as they pounded on the glass doors of Canada's biggest stock market. One man wearing a mask and combat fatigues was seen hurling himself against the doors.\nProtest organisers later moved the rally away from the doors of the exchange.\nIn another part of the city, Ontario Finance Minister Ernie Eves said it was ironic that some of the groups that are protesting have huge pension funds that invest in stocks.\nProtesters hit Toronto streets, paralysing rush-hour subway trains and closing businesses in Canada's biggest city to protest deep budget cuts by Ontario's Conservative government.\nSubway and bus service ground to a halt in this city of 2.2 million people, forcing about one million commuters to walk, drive or cycle to work or just stay home.\nUnionized workers, civil servants and social activists also descended on government offices and factories in the first day of the so-called \"Days of Protest\" against budget cutbacks.\nBut picketers failed to disrupt commuter trains from Toronto's bedroom communities or interrupt service at Pearson Airport, the country's busiest. Expected traffic jams on the city expressways also did not materialise.\nIn the days leading up to the protest, a siege mentality gripped Toronto's Bay Street, the heart of Canada's financial community.\nAt least one brokerage firm flew traders to its offices in New York and Montreal, while other brokers slept in hotel rooms or in their offices overnight.\nOther companies hired boats to ferry employees across Lake Ontario from nearby communities.\nThe protesters are furious with Premier Mike Harris' plans to cut spending by C$8 billion ($5.9 billion) to wipe out a huge deficit by the turn of the century.\nSince sweeping to power in 1995 promising a right-wing revolution in Canada's most populous province, the Conservatives have revamped labour laws, slashed welfare payments, introduced workfare and announced plans to close hospitals and trim education budgets.\n\"These cuts that Harris made are hurting the workers. This is part of the polarisation that is happening in Ontario. The anger is going to grow and grow,\" Syd Ryan, president of the Ontario division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, told picketers outside a government building.\nBut Harris, who has been dubbed \"Newt of the North\" in reference to Republican U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, has vowed the protests will not stall his \"Common Sense Revolution.\"\n\"Will they discourage us from creating more jobs? No. Discourage us from workfare? No. That's what we were elected to do and I don't expect that most of the public want us to change from that agenda,\" Harris told reporters.\nThe Conservatives' popularity has held at around 50 percent in recent opinion polls.\nMany commuters took the delays in stride.\n\"I see the protesters have a point, but I think it's going to inconvenience a lot of people who don't have any other choice,\" said John Ivarey.\nA poll taken this week found that 67 percent of Toronto residents opposed the \"Days of Action\" rallies.\nProtesters waved placards and temporarily blocked cars from entering government parking lots, but Toronto police said there were no major incidents of violence.\nOne man was charged with a weapons offence after allegedly threatening picketers with a baseball bat outside a bus garage. There also were skirmishes outside a postal station.\nSeveral major manufacturers cancelled day shifts. De Havilland Inc., a unit of transportation firm Bombardier Inc. , said 6,200 employees at its Toronto aircraft plant would be off the job Friday.",

        "Text": "Shivering icewine enthusiasts, battered by icy winds, headed into a snow-covered vineyard on a recent night to harvest one of the world's rarest wines.\nAlthough Germany discovered the luscious dessert wine in the late 18th century, Canada is the world's largest producer of icewine -- capturing many international awards and helping shed an industry reputation for screw-top plonk that neither amuses nor has any pretentions.\nIf you can find it, this \"liquid gold\" can cost up to C$200 ($150) a bottle in icewine-crazy Japan -- four times the price in Canada. Japan is by far the biggest export market, but China and South Korea are also developing a taste for it.\nBut on this cold winter night a cup of piping hot coffee could fetch a better price than any chilled wine. \"It's cold, hard work. You're outside in the dark picking frozen grapes and wondering why you're not asleep like normal people,\" Greg Berti, general manager of Hillebrand Estates Winery, said on a recent midnight tour of Hillebrand's icewine fields.\nMost of the Canadian vintage comes from the Niagara wine region where 24 wineries produced 29,700 gallons (112,500 liters) in 1995. That is up 57 percent from 1994 but paltry compared to the eight million gallons (30 million liters) of regular wine produced yearly in Ontario, Canada's most populous province.\nSome California wineries produce sweet wines but they are shunned by icewine purists because the grapes are artificially frozen. \"Their wine is interesting, but it's not in the same league as icewine,\" Berti said.\nIT MAY BE RARE BUT IT TASTES LIKE PEACHES\nAlthough Niagara wineries say their products are unique in taste, icewine is generally amber or golden in colour with a full-flavored taste similar to honey, apricots or peaches. It is thicker than regular wine, with an alcohol content of about 10 percent, compared to 40 percent for a cognac or brandy.\nCanada exports icewine to Germany, Denmark, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States. China and Korea are also emerging markets. But the biggest buyers are Japanese tourists who flock to the Niagara region by the busload -- snapping up several bottles of icewine after a visit to nearby Niagara Falls.\nHillebrand sells about 75 percent of its icewine to Japanese who tour its winery. \"Their image of Canada is Banff, Anne of Green Gables and Niagara Falls, and icewine fits in with that image,\" Berti said.\nLast summer, a group of 74 Japanese race horse owners descended on another Niagara winery and drove off with more than $10,000 worth of icewine. \"They came into the winery, sampled, bought and were back in their bus in 45 minutes,\" recalled Debi Pratt, director of public relations for Inniskillin Wines Inc.\nALMOST AS HARD TO PRODUCE AS GOLD\nIt takes every grape from an entire vine to yield enough juice to make one bottle of icewine -- 10 times the amount used to make regular wines. Many grapes are lost to hungry birds, hail or harsh winter winds before they are picked.\nBut Canada has plenty of what is needed most to make icewine -- consistently cold weather.\nThe grapes -- hardy Vidal or Riesling varieties -- must be picked off the vine when temperatures are well below freezing.\nMost wineries set aside part of their vineyards in October when the regular wine harvest ends. By mid-December or early January the shriveled grapes have turned a brownish hue and pickers are on call, waiting for the right weather.\nBerti said Mother Nature has sometimes forced crews to pick on Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve -- although that did not happen this year.\n\"The wind is the biggest problem. Every hour or half hour we take a break for hot coffee and donuts,\" Gregory Synos, a six-year veteran of the icewine harvest, said.\nThe grapes are sorted and rushed to the winery where presses work into the night. The juice then goes through several weeks of fermentation, followed by a few months of ageing in oak barrels to smooth out the acidity and tanins in immature icewine.\nAlthough Hillebrand has tried to modernise the process by using special presses and protective netting for the grapes, Berti conceded: \"There is nothing efficent about it. You have to get into the fields when the getting is good.\"",

Canadians currently spend between C$40 billion ($29 billion) and C$60 billion ($44 billion) using small coins and bills.\n\"With Exact you don't have to carry as many small bills and coins, and you'll always have the exact change required to make fast, convenient purchases,\" said Ron Hodge, vice president of card and direct services for TD Bank.\nCanadians are among the biggest users of plastic cards in the world. They carry an estimated 46.2 million debt and credit cards, while use of these cards has jumped 43 percent in the past year, according to a recent industry survey.\n\"Technology is rapidly changing the face of money, providing faster, easier and more secure transactions. This is only the beginning,\" said Tim Hockey, vice president of core banking services for Canada Trust.\nExact will be followed in early 1997 by a community-wide test of Mondex, a rival \"smart\" card system developed in Britain. Exact is based on smart card technology developed by Belgium-based Banksys.\nRoyal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce will roll out their Mondex system in Guelph, a city of about 100,000 people 50 miles (80 kms) west of Toronto.\nBoth systems are similar in that they involve storing money on a computer chip embedded within a card. When a customer uses the card to make a purchase, the value is subtracted from the card.\nCustomers simply insert their card in the merchant's special, hand-held purchase terminal. The merchant enters the purchase price and the customer presses the \"OK\" button.\nThe electronic value of the sale is collected in the purchase terminal and transferred via telephone modem to the merchant's bank account at the end of the day.\nExact users can load, or electronically transfer cash from bank account to the card, up to C$200 ($147) from terminals in the Kingston branches of Bank of Montreal, TD Bank and Canada Trust. Load terminals will also be located in shopping malls, student campuses and selected stores.\nThe card will initally be offered at no charge. But after an introductory period, each financial institution will set a fee for its own customers.",

That's what has been missing the last few years,\" Flutie said after winning his second Grey Cup since 1992 when he was with the Calgary Stampeders.\nFlutie completed 22 of 35 passes for 302 yards and made a 10-yard scramble for a touchdown.\nCanadian newspapers have reported that the CFL's new salary cap may prevent Toronto from paying Flutie's annual salary of $1 million Canadian (about $750,000 U.S.) -- the highest in the league.\nThe snowy, slippery contest was a typical Grey Cup in which weather played a critical role. The steady snowfall blanketed Hamilton's Ivor Wynne Stadium for most of the game and kept field crews busy.\nDespite the conditions, it was the second-highest scoring Grey Cup game. The highlights included a 91-yard kick return by the Eskimos' Henry \"Gizmo\" Williams which set a new Grey Cup record.\nThe championship capped a chaotic, money-losing season which left many fans wondering if they will see the venerable Grey Cup next year.\n\"After a game like this, it would be a real shame if the CFL folded,\" said parka-clad Bob Forbes, one of 38,595 spectators who huddled against the weather.\nDespite returning to its Canadian roots this year after a failed expansion into the United States, the CFL is dripping red ink.\nThe Grey Cup was not a sell-out, and all but one of the CFL's nine clubs will lose money, due to dwindling crowds and cash bailouts to keep teams in Ottawa, Montreal and Vancouver afloat during the 1996 season.\nThe 120-year-old Ottawa Rough Riders franchise folded in Canada's capital at the end of the regular season.\nThe cash-strapped Eskimos could not afford to fly players' wives to the game.\nAverage CFL attendance slipped to around 22,000 fans a game from 24,400 in 1995, despite a slick \"Radically Canadian\" marketing campaign trumpeting the league's national heritage.",

Transit officials on Thursday won a partial injunction against picketing at subway stations.\nGO Transit, the train service that links suburban communities to Toronto, warned commuters that \"service may be delayed, adjusted, interrupted or even cancelled.\"\nAir travellers can also expect delays at Pearson Airport, which handles about 65,000 passengers a day, said airport spokesman Bruce Reid.\nA Canadian court ruled Wednesday that picketers cannot interfere with essential airport workers, but can set up informational pickets. Airlines have promised to re-schedule flights if there are significant delays.\nMeanwhile, several major manufacturers have cancelled day shifts.

They will be record earnings, rest assured,\" Roy Palmer, a banking analyst with TD Sercurities Inc., said on Friday.\nNational Bank of Canada, the smallest of the Big Six, also reports its earnings next Thursday.\nBank of Montreal, Scotiabank and TD posted double-digit increases in net income this week -- with strong growth in personal, corporate and investment banking. The earnings so far have been in line with analysts' forecasts.\n\"There were no surprises. Just really solid quarters from everybody,\" said CIBC Wood Gundy analyst Mark Maxwell.\nThe banks' investment, brokerage and mutual fund businesses enjoyed a banner year as financial markets soared in 1996.\nRoyal Bank's investment arm. RBC Dominion Securities Ltd, has already posted a record profit. RBC said on Thursday its earnings jumped to C$154.3 million ($114 million) in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, up from C$77 million ($57 million) a year ago.\n\"In addition to two major mergers...each of our four global businesses turned in strong performances contributing to record results for the year,\" said RBC president Reay Mackay.\nRBC recently completed its C$480 million ($355 million) purchase of brokerage firm Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd., and merged some operations with parent Royal Bank.\nCIBC's investment unit is also expected to post bullish earnings when the bank reports its results next week.\nAnalysts said earnings growth for the Big Six is expected slow in 1997, particularly if bond and stock markets cool off.\nHowever, TD Bank expects the boom to continue. \"The current low level of interest rates should result in increased economic activity in Canada in 1997 and the gradual return of consumer confidence,\" said TD president Charles Baillie.\nMore dividend hikes are possible next week following increases at Scotiabank and TD.\nScotiabank raised its payout by C3 cents (2 cents) to C37 cents (27 cents) a share, its second increase of 1996. TD boosted its dividend by C3 cents (2 cents) to C28 cents (21 cents) a share.\n\"I would be astonished if CIBC did not increase its dividend at this time,\" said Palmer. CIBC last raised its dividend by C5 cents (4 cents) to C45 cents (33 cents) last June.\nMaxwell said there is less pressure on Royal Bank and National Bank to raise their dividends now, but an increase may come in early 1997.\nImproved credit quality also contributed to bottom lines of Scotiabank, Bank of Montreal and TD.\nAll three banks reported lower loan loss provisions for 1996. TD surprising analysts with a deeper-than-expected drop in its provision to C$152 million ($112 million) from C$180 million ($133 million) in 1995.\nAnalysts said loan losses for the Big Six appear to have touched bottom and are expected to creep higher next year.",

The Dutch financial services giant dwarfs Royal Bank, the country's biggest financial institution with assets of $147 billion.\nING, already a player in Canada's insurance market, plans to offer a wide range of electronic banking services through a new subsidiary, ING Trust Co. of Canada, based in Toronto.\nING is keeping a low profile until its application for a trust licence is approved, but bank officials are confident of success where others have failed.\nIn recent years, several foreign banks abandoned Canada because of its restrictive banking laws and stiffer than expected competition from the big domestic banks.\n\"It would be fair to say that we will be competing on several fronts. It won't be hard to offer better service,\" said Jim Kelly, vice-president of marketing for ING's Canadian operations.\nING WILL DRAW ON ITS EUROPEAN EXPERIENCE\nHe said ING will draw on its extensive experience in electronic banking in Europe.\nAnalysts have said ING can use Canada to fine tune its virtual bank before offering similar services in the larger U.S. market. But Kelly said there are no plans yet to take ING's virtual bank south of the border.\n\"To say we're definitely going to the U.S. would be wrong. To say that we would look at it and see if there is a market opportunity, yes, of course we would,\" he said.\nAlso eyeing Canada's consumer banking market is Citibank Canada, a unit of U.S. giant Citicorp, which is joining with Canadian fund manager AGF Management Ltd., to create a virtual trust company.\nThe venture is Citibank's second foray into Canadian consumer banking after abandoning a bid to establish a traditional branch system in the 1980s.\nCharles Stuart, country manager of Citibank's consumer banking operations in Canada, said the joint venture gives the bank access to AGF's customer base. Citibank plans to offer customers a full-service banking package, including credit cards, access to ATM service and telephone banking.\n\"We're not locked into the costs of a bricks-and-mortar structure. So we can serve them through technology and that enables us to price ourselves very competitively,\" he said.\nThe Citibank/AGF venture could set a pattern for other foreign banks seeking to enter Canada with an established customer base, Stuart said.\nBIG BANKS UNDER PRESSURE FROM LOCAL RIVALS\nThe Big Six banks are pressured by local rivals as well.\nLast month, Vancouver City Savings Credit Union, the country's biggest credit union with $3.6 billion in assets, applied to open a nationwide branchless bank early next year.\nWhile cyber competitors are poised to invade the retail market, Canada's major banks are also on the move.\nThe banks spent a record $1.7 billion on new technology in 1995 and that is expected to reach $1.9 billion by 1998, according to a report by accounting firm Ernst & Young.\nMuch of the money is being poured into alternative delivery channels such as point-of-sale credit and debit cards, ATMs, telephone and computer banking.\nCards account for more than a third of all payment transactions in Canada, up from 25 percent a year ago.\nTelephone and computer transactions are climbing as well. Traditional bank transactions are seen falling to 21 percent in 1998 from 38 percent last year.\nAmong Canadian banks, Royal Bank is the top player in telephone banking with more than 800,000 subscribers. Bank officials expect 40 percent of their eight million customers to be using alternative channels in five years.\nLast month, Royal Bank joined 14 other North American banks to set up a computer banking network with computer giant IBM in early 1997.\nAll the banks are struggling to decide the future of their branch networks, but CIBC has taken the first steps to overhaul its 1,400 branches.\nIn a recent pilot project, CIBC employed greeters to guide customers to ATMs for their basic banking needs. Bank tellers were retrained to advise customers on such products as mutual funds, loans and mortgages.\nBilling it as the bank branch of the future, CIBC said transaction costs had fallen dramatically, while customer lineups were much thinner.\nBut by using these low-cost channels, customers will expect a break on service fees, which many consumers complain are too high, Ernst & Young said.\nBank of Nova Scotia has taken the acquisition route to boost its Internet services. It recently bought a 10 percent stake in iSTAR Internet Inc., an Internet solutions firm, to help develop new channels and services for the bank.",

Other international businesses contributed C$102 million ($76 million) to the bank's bottom line, up 1 percent from 1995.\nSpeaking to reporters, Barrett said the bank should meet or exceed 10 percent growth in annual earnings per share going forward.\n\"There is sufficient counter cyclicality built into the range of businesses and range of geographies that we're operating in now that we continue to feel that we would be able to maintain that 10 percent EPS growth or better in the years ahead,\" Barrett said.\nThe bank's earnings were generally in line with estimates.\nFourth quarter earnings rose to C$1.04 (77 cents) a share from 93 cents (69 cents) in the same period in 1995.\n\"They were a little weaker than what I was looking for, but pretty much in line for intents and purposes,\" said Kevin Choquette, an analyst with Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc.\nChoquette had forecast fourth quarter earnings of C$1.06 (79 cents) a share.\nImproved credit quality also contributed to the bank's strong performance. It's provision for credit losses fell to C$225 million ($168 million) in 1996 from C$275 million ($205 million) in 1995.\nBarrett told reporters that the bank will plan for a credit loss provision of C$275 million in 1997.\n\"We'll stick with that until we are six months into the year and see how the credit cycle shakes out,\" he said.\nBank of Montreal's stock closed down C$0.45 (33 cents) to C$44.20 (33 cents) in heavy turnover of 1.5 million shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\nThe recent rally in Canadian bank stocks pushed Bank of Montreal's return on investment up 42.4 percent in 1996, compared to a 24-percent gain last year.\nDespite today's weakness in Bank of Montreal shares, the TSE's banks and trusts index climbed 14 points to a new high of 6164.60.",

Typically bargaining runs around the clock when a settlement is near.\nThe deadline marks the first time the UAW has threatened a strike in its 1996 negotiations with Detroit's Big Three automakers, which up to now have been marked by an unusually conciliatory tone and extremely secretive discussions.\nIt also came two days after GM's 26,000 Canadian Auto Workers members began returning to work on Wednesday after a three-week strike against the automaker's Canadian operations.\nIn the U.S. talks, the two sides are still at odds over the same issues that caused the walkout in Canada -- the union's demand for job security and GM's desire to sell several parts plants and maintain flexibility to shift components work to outside suppliers, a practice known as outsourcing.\nGM wants to modify the UAW contract pattern set by Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., which have agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current UAW work forces over the next three years.\nGM, the least efficient U.S. automaker, wants to exclude certain components plants from the employment guarantees, including a door hardware plant in Flint, Michigan and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Michigan.\nFord and Chrysler buy more of their parts from outside suppliers than GM does, often from firms that pay their workers significantly less than the $19-an-hour base wage paid in Big Three factories.\nYokich said in a statement on Friday that he was not optimistic that a deal could be reached before the deadline but told workers to remain on the job until further notice.\nOn Saturday UAW spokesman Reg McGhee declined to say whether the union was still pessimistic about the talks.\n\"That was yesterday's statement,\" McGhee said. \"We're just saying that the talks are continuing and we're not characterising the progress.\"\nGM spokesman Charles Licari said the automaker was prepared for round-the-clock negotiations, but declined to provide further details of the talks.\nGM, flush with $14 billion in cash on its balance sheet and operating earnings that more than doubled in the third quarter to $1 billion, has shown willingness to sustain costly strikes to continue its quest for competitiveness.\nIndustry analysts estimate the cost of the Canadian strike at $150 million to $450 million, while a 17-day strike at two Dayton, Ohio, brake plants in March reduced GM's first quarter profit by $900 million.\nBut the effects of the Canadian strike continued to linger last week, as more of GM's U.S. assembly plants plants ran out of Canadian-made parts.",

        "Text": "Boosting the pressure on General Motors Corp. for a new labour agreement, the United Auto Workers union Friday set a Sunday night deadline for a strike against the world's largest automaker.\nUAW President Stephen Yokich said in a statment that union negotiators were not optimistic that a new contract deal could be reached by the deadline of 11:59 p.m. EST Sunday (0459 GMT Monday).\nWhile he did not say if the union's 215,000 GM hourly workers would actually strike, Yokich said the UAW had notified GM that it will terminate its extended 1993 contract with the automaker if the deadline passes with no agreement. The union typically does not work without a contract.\n\"UAW members have been advised to continue to work unless notified by their local union,\" Yokich said.\n\"The UAW bargaining team will continue to make serious efforts to achieve a new agreement. While we are not optimistic, we remain hopeful that this can be accomplished prior to the expiration of the current contract at 11:59 p.m. on Sunday,\" he added.\nThe move comes just three days after GM settled a contentious, 20-day strike with the Canadian Auto Workers union that caused parts shortages that are still forcing the auto giant to shut down some U.S. assembly plants.\nAlthough the UAW talks had been moving quickly before the strike in Canada, people close to the negotiations said the two sides remain at odds over the union's demand for employment guarantees and GM's desire for flexibility to shift more parts work to outside, usually non-union suppliers.\nBoth Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current work forces over the next three years. GM has resisted the pattern, saying it wants to exclude certain components plants from the employment guarantees.\nA GM spokesman said full-scale UAW negotiations at GM's Detroit headquarters will continue throughout the weekend for the first time since the strike in Canada began on Oct. 2.\nIn a statement, GM chief negotiator Gerald Knechtel said, \"We remain committed to entering into agreement that balances the needs of our employees and the UAW with the flexibility GM needs to continue to improve our competitiveness.\"\n\"We've had open and constructive dialogue with the UAW since the talks began and we're hopeful we can focus with the UAW on concluding these negotiations as soon as possible.\"\nMeanwhile, GM continued to run out of Canadian-made parts at U.S. assembly plants. In Flint, Mich., local UAW officials said GM told more than 6,600 workers not to report to work at the automaker's massive Buick City complex on Monday.\nThe facility makes Buick LeSabre, Oldsmobile 88 and Pontiac Bonneville sedans, as well as V-6 engines and other components.\nBuick City is the largest of several facilities to cut back production due to shortages of parts following the end of the Canadian Auto Workers' strike this week.\nOn Thursday, GM laid off about 5,000 workers at its Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant in a shutdown that will last two weeks. The plant builds the popular Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire small cars.\nAlso on Friday, GM notified some of the 2,926 workers at the nearby Lordstown metal stamping plant they would be idled next week. Another 474 workers at a components plant in Vandalia, Ohio, will be idled next week, GM said.\nExcluding the layoffs that will start next week, GM said it had a total of 23,340 workers idled in the United States and Mexico on Friday.\nGM's 26,000 Canadian Auto Workers members began returning to work on Wednesday after they ratified a new contract that puts some limits GM's ability to shift work to outside suppliers but allows the automaker to sell two contested parts plants.",

Among those were a door hinge plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that GM has put on the sale block.\nThe proposed exceptions to the pattern were aimed at allowing GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, to cut costs and boost productivity.\nAlthough all three of the companies pay a base wage of about $19 an hour, Ford and Chrysler buy more of their parts from lower-cost outside suppliers than GM does. GM wanted the ability to \"outsource\" more of its parts work.\nEconomic provisions of the GM contract were expected to follow those at Ford and Chrysler, offering workers a $2,000 bonus in the first year of the contract, followed by 3 percent increases in base wages during the second and third years.\nThe deal came as GM's production losses due to strikes at a metal stamping plant in Indianapolis and a truck plant in Janesville, Wis., mounted on Friday.\nBy late Friday, more than 19,000 workers at seven plants were idled, including 2,750 strikers in Indianapolis and 4,800 in Janesville.",

        "Text": "General Motors Corp.  has packed its new EV1 electric vehicle with exotic materials and sophisticated, unproven technology, but is taking a cautious approach to introducing it to the public.\nGM officials said Tuesday they plan to offer the two-seat car only on three-year leases and will hold the customer's hand virtually every step of the way.\n\"Our total focus is to provide a hassle-free experience and comprehensive customer care,\" said Joseph Kennedy, vice president of sales and marketing for GM's Saturn unit, which will sell the EV1 under the GM nameplate.\nThe first modern production car designed from the ground up to be an electric vehicle, the EV1 will roll into Saturn dealerships sometime this fall in the Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz., areas. Colder climates would shorten the vehicles' already limited range, which is a maximum of 70 to 90 miles under ideal conditions, GM says.\nCalifornia, which recently eased its 1998 mandate for electric vehicles, is expected to offer consumer incentives for the vehicle.\nDepending on such incentives, monthly lease payments on the car will probably fall between $400 and $500, about the same as a $30,000 luxury car, GM officials said at a news briefing.\nCustomers will have to add another $50 a month or so to lease a 220-volt charging unit and pay to have it mounted in their garage. But the electricity to run the EV1 is a bargain -- about a penny a mile, versus gasoline costs of four to five cents a mile for an average normal car.\nGM executives will not discuss production plans or sales targets for the vehicle and say they plan to let market dictate demand. But Kennedy said he expects the initial demand to outstrip supply due to the vehicle's novelty.\nSo far, about 1,000 people have called a toll-free telephone number, and dealers have taken names of 300 serious customers, including Tonight Show host Jay Leno, he said.\nCustomers who want performance won't be disappointed with the EV1. The whisper-quiet vehicle offers neck-snapping acceleration and sports-car like handling, although a heavy foot will quickly drain the battery, requiring a three- to four-hour recharge.\n\"We can keep up with a Nissan 300ZX from zero to 30\" miles an hour, said Sean McNamara, marketing manager for GM's Advanced Technology Vehicles group.\nThe car's aerodynamic tear-drop shape, considerably narrower in the rear than in the front, slips through the wind easily and looks unlike anything else on the road.\nGM could have built a spartan small boxy car but wanted its first electric vehicle to have some flair, said Robert Purcell, general manager of GM Advanced Technology Vehicles.\n\"This is the car that gets the market started,\" he said. \"We wanted to put out a car that was very exciting so that people would fall in love with it.\"\nThe sporty configuration was aimed at highly educated customers with incomes of $125,000 a year who like high technology, GM said. The customers also likely own two other vehicles for longer trips or heavy hauling.\nSaturn, which won't necessarily sell all future GM electric vehicles, plans to emphasise its customer-friendly sales practices more heavily for the EV1.\nThe decision to lease the vehicle was made in part to protect consumers from the inevitable march of technology. The automaker does not want EV1 customers to be stuck with obsolete cars in a few years, as personal computer owners often are.\nAt the end of the lease, GM is considering refitting the plastic and aluminum-bodied cars with newer technology and leasing them again, Purcell said.\nThe division also is training about 14 EV1 \"product specialists\" to handle sales of the vehicle at 26 designated dealerships in California and Arizona.\nThe specialists will come to a prospective customer's home, office, or elsewhere to explain the details of the car and the charging unit.\nThey'll work with the utility companies and arrange municipal permits for the installations, Kennedy said, adding that it will probably take about a week to set up a customer with a car and charger.\nGM has invested $350 million in developing the EV1, which it does not expect to recoup through sales of the first generation vehicle, Purcell said. But the car does pioneer a wide range of exotic materials and new technology that could find its way to other GM vehicles.\nMagnesium and other lightweight materials counteract the weight of batteries, and the cars have braking systems that transfer power back to the battery.\nDespite the technology, the cars are largely hand-built at a Lansing, Mich., plant that produced the now-defunct Buick Reatta in the late 1980s. The operation employs 54 production workers but could be expanded quickly, GM officials said.",

        "Text": "Chrysler Corp. said Monday it rode strong sales of its pickup trucks, minivans and sport/utility vehicles to a 92 percent jump in third-quarter profits, soundly beating Wall Street's optimistic forecasts.\nDetroit's No. 3 automaker earned $680 million, or 93 cents a share, in the July-September period, setting records for both net income and earnings per share for the third quarter.\nA year earlier, when Chrysler was struggling through the slow production launch of its current-generation minivans, the company earned just $354 million, or 45 cents a share.\n\"Chrysler's performance in the third quarter was outstanding,\" Chairman Robert Eaton said in a statement. \"It was fuelled by record-setting demand for our products, which led to a new third-quarter U.S. retail unit sales record and produced the best model year for U.S. retail unit sales in the company's history.\"\nThe results included an after-tax charge of $55 million, or 7 cents a share, to cover costs of an early retirement programme. About 531 salaried employees opted to leave the company under the programme during the quarter.\nExcluding the charge, Chrysler earned $735 million, or $1 a share, from operations, solidly exceeding Wall Street estimates. According to First Call, which tracks earnings estimates, analysts had expected Chrysler to earn about $520 million, or 71 cents a share.\nChrysler shares jumped $1 to $32.75 after touching $33 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\"I think it was all in the sales mix,\" Burnham Securities analyst David Healy said of Chrysler's strong performance. \"They've raised prices and the mix has shifted to trucks. They're selling not so many Neons and a lot more Jeep Grand Cherokees and Town & Country minivans.\"\nIndeed, light trucks -- which typically carry higher profit margins than passenger cars -- made up 66 percent of Chrysler's sales mix, versus 62 percent in the 1995 quarter. The automaker had full availability of its new minivans, and a St. Louis plant that had just started building Dodge Ram pickup trucks in August 1995 is now churning the vehicles out.\nChrysler earned a profit of $982 on each vehicle in the quarter, almost double the $492 earned per vehicle a year earlier. Incentive spending fell to $685 per vehicle from $870 a year ago, but was up from $625 in the second quarter.\nChrysler Chief Financial Officer Gary Valade said he expected similar conditions in the fourth quarter, and added that Chrysler next year plans another big increase in truck-building capacity.\nHe told reporters on a conference call that the automaker will be able to build 190,000 more trucks in 1997 than in 1996, including the launch of a new Dodge sport/utility vehicle at Chrysler's Newark, Del., plant.\nThe four-door vehicle is expected to be based on the new Dodge Dakota pickup truck that Chrysler is launching and will give Dodge dealers their first sport/utility vehicle since the two-door Ram Charger was discontinued in 1993.\nValade said Chrysler will end the year with about 16.2 percent of the North American car and light truck market, but cautioned the company will be prudent when adding capacity.\n\"We don't feel ourselves share constrained at this 16 percent share level, but neither are we hell-bent to get to 20 (percent) at any cost,\" he said.\nSales climbed to $14.4 billion, a third-quarter record and up 20 percent from $12.0 billion in the 1995 quarter.\nThe automaker said it shipped 650,529 cars and trucks, up from 581,853 in the year-ago period, boosting its share of the combined U.S. and Canadian retail car and truck market to 15.5 percent from 13.6 percent in the third quarter of 1995.\nIn the international market, Chrysler's retail sales were 57,209 vehicles, up 19 percent over the 48,207 vehicles it sold in the third quarter of 1995.\nIn Europe, Chrysler vehicle sales rose 28 percent.\nThe automaker said it bought back $452 million of its common stock in the quarter, bringing the total for 1996 to $1.6 billion, out of a $2 billion programme. The company bought back $1 billion worth of stock in 1995 and under its five-year peace accord with billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, has pledged to buy back another $1 billion in 1997.\nFor the nine months, earnings were $2.72 billion, or $3.65 a share, nearly triple the $985 million, or $1.28 a share, in the first nine months of 1995.",

Analysts estimate that GM makes about $9,000 in variable profits on each of the trucks.\nIn addition to Janesville and Fort Wayne, the Indianapolis plant supplies facilities in Pontiac and Flint, Mich.; Oshawa, Ontario; Linden, N.J.; Shreveport, La.; Moraine, Ohio, and Silao, Mexico.\n\"It really starts to add up quickly when you add in all of the other big C/K pickups they can lose,\" said Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi.\nThe UAW strikes came as GM is still staggering from a three-week strike in Canada that curtailed production at a number of U.S. plants and may cost up to $450 million.\nOn Wednesday, GM said it still had 23,158 U.S. workers idled due to shortages of Canadian-made parts, but added that 3,200 workers at its Buick City assembly plant in Flint, Mich., were scheduled to return to work on Thursday.\nNo other UAW strikes had started on Wednesday, but UAW spokesman Reg McGhee said the union was not ruling out other walkouts. UAW President Stephen Yokich raised the threat of local strikes on Monday after GM's national contract covering 215,000 UAW workers expired.\n\"Steve made it clear that without a national contract, the locals are on their own,\" McGhee said, noting that they do not have to provide GM with the typical five-day notice before a walkout.\nSome UAW officials speculated that other stamping and parts plants may also be struck, because they would force shutdowns at other facilities.\nNational contract talks continued Wednesday at GM's Detroit headquarters, but officials declined to say whether progress was being made.\n\"Talks are taking place at all levels,\" said GM spokesman Charles Licari.\nAlthough UAW officials said the strikes were called over local issues, analysts said it was clear that the actions were aimed at pushing GM into a tentative national agreement.\nThat may take place before Saturday, when about 250 UAW leaders from GM plants across the nation are scheduled to meet in Detroit to discuss the status of the talks.\nThe future of 12 domestic parts plants that GM considers uncompetitive remained a major sticking point in the negotiations Wednesday. GM wants to exclude several of the plants from union demands that it guarantee employment for 95 percent of UAW workers over the next three years.\nFord Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have already granted such guarantees, but GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, wants changes to the pattern to allow it to cut costs.\nGM has already put two of the 12 plants on the sale block -- a door hinge plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that together employ 2,100 workers.\n\"We know the sale is going to happen. We're concerned about what's going to happen to us,\" said Whitey Hale, president of UAW Local 326 in Flint.",

Along with a second, still-unresolved walkout at GM's Janesville, Wisconsin, truck plant, the dispute was responsible for the idling of more than 19,000 workers.\nBut the 2,750 Indianapolis strikers could be back on the job stamping out fenders, doors, hoods and other truck body parts by Sunday night following a ratification vote scheduled for Sunday morning, said Patrick Morrissey, a spokesman for GM's Metal Fabricating Division.\nHowever, GM's full-size pickup truck plant in Pontiac, Michigan, may still shut down on Monday due to shortages of Indianapolis-made parts, joining four other idled truck plants and an crippled engine plant.\nRonald Gettelfinger, UAW regional director in Indianapolis, said the new local labor agreement, reached at about 6:15 p.m. EST (2315 GMT) on Saturday, was not influenced by the national GM-UAW labor accord, which covers 215,000 U.S. hourly workers.\nThe national contract defines wages, benefits, job security and other broad issues, while local pacts cover plant specific issues like work rules and staffing levels.\n\"We've got great negotiators at the top,\" Gettelfinger said. \"This was local issues.\"\nHe declined to discuss the grievances that sparked the strike. They were believed to include demands for more jobs to cope with an increasing workload and protections for skilled trades workers.\nUAW President Stephen Yokich, who announced the national pact at a 2 a.m. EST (0700 GMT) news conference, held out the threat of more local strikes to keep GM from dragging its feet in negotiations with its 123 locals.\n\"We can't tell you what's going to happen in the other locals,\" Yokich said. \"I would suggest that the company work very hard and get their locals cleaned up.\"\nPresident Bill Clinton applauded UAW-GM agreement on Saturday. \"I am very hopeful that the tentative agreement will be ratified and that the outstanding local issues will quickly be resolved so that everyone can get back to work,\" he said.\nAbout 4,800 workers in Janesville remain on strike, although UAW Local 95 officials said local talks intensified on Saturday. The plant, which builds GM's popular Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon sport-utility vehicles, is one of the automaker's most profitable factories.\nAnalysts estimate the UAW-related shutdowns will cost the carmaker up to $20 million a day in lost profits, on top of an estimated $350 million loss from a Canadian walkout that ended on Oct. 23.\nThe UAW-GM national agreement will be submitted to rank-and-file members for ratification after about 250 UAW leaders meet to consider the pact on Wednesday in Chicago. The deal was unanimously approved by the union's national GM bargaining council.\nDetails of the pact were not released on Saturday, but Gerald Knechtel, GM vice president of personnel, said it fits within the pattern that the UAW set at Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp\nBoth of those companies agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current hourly workforces and will give workers a $2,000 bonus in the first year of the contract, followed by 3 percent raises in the second and third years of the contract.\nOne union official said the pact maintains the 95 percent job guarantee but allows GM some flexibility to exit certain unprofitable businesses and to allow employment at some factories to fall below that threshold.\nIn a sign that contentious issues remain, company and union officials did not announce the pact in a joint news conference with the traditional handshakes and smiles. Instead, they made grim-faced separate statements to reporters gathered at GM's Detroit headquarters building.\n\"I think we said back in June that it would be a difficult negotiation, and I think we fulfilled that expectation,\" said a visibly tired GM Chairman Jack Smith. \"Like any negotiation, you never get everything you want.\"",

's Cadillac assembly plant here will not report to work on Monday because of the Canadian Auto Workers strike and thousands more U.S. assembly employees may be laid off this week, GM said on Sunday.\nThe Cadillac plant on the outskirts of Detroit will operate with only one shift on Monday and Tuesday, when it is expected to halt production completely unless the strike is resolved, GM spokesman Thomas Klipstine said.\n\"Once they run out of parts, that's it,\" he said.\nThe plant employs more than 3,000 hourly workers represented by the United Auto Workers union, but Klipstine said he did not know the exact number of workers on each shift.\nThe sprawling factory, which builds Cadillac's DeVille, Seville and Eldorado luxury cars, depends on interior trim parts made at a strike-bound plant in Windsor, Ontario, just across the Detroit River.\nGM's Canadian workers began an escalating strike on Oct. 3, shutting down all of the automaker's operations in Canada by late on Oct. 9.\nThe company and union have been unable to reach an agreement for a new national labour contract for GM's 26,000 CAW members because of disagreements over the thorny issue of shifting parts work to outside suppliers, known as outsourcing.\nThe union wants tough restrictions on outsourcing to protect its members' jobs, while GM, the least efficient automaker in North America, says it needs flexibility on parts purchases to become more competitive.\nSo far, GM's U.S. operations have been relatively untouched by the strike in Canada, largely because the CAW gave the automaker ample warning that it was preparing to strike. That, coupled with the slow escalation of the strike over a week-long period, allowed GM to build up stocks of some parts and prepare for the walkout.\n\"The bottom line is there was no surprise with this strike,\" Klipstine said. \"We did as much as we could, but we don't have huge amounts of parts stockpiled.\"\nKlipstine said he did not know how much longer GM could operate its U.S. plants.\nIndustry analysts have said some of GM's plants may be able to continue to operate until the end of the month, particularly those that build GM's popular full-size pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles.\nOn Friday, Ford Motor Co. President Alex Trotman said he did not believe his company would be able to gain a significant amount of market share due to the strike, because there has been \"little evidence\" that GM's hottest-selling truck lines will be affected.\nMost GM dealers have sufficient car inventories to weather the strike without turning away customers, he said.\nThus far, the CAW has been responsible for the idling of only 2,000 U.S. workers.\nThe walkout forced the layoff of 1,050 workers at an engine plant in Tonawanda, N.Y., near Buffalo, and 950 at a transmission plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., near Detroit.\nBy contrast, a UAW strike in March at two Dayton, Ohio, brake plants had forced more than 55,000 of GM's workers off the job just one week after that walkout began.\nNo formal talks were scheduled between GM and the CAW, although CAW President Buzz Hargrove was expected to be in contact with GM's chief negotiator, Dean Munger.\nCanada celebrates its national Thanksgiving Day holiday on Monday.\nMeanwhile, in the United States, negotiators working towards a contract for GM's 215,000 United Auto Workers members also took the weekend off.\nThe UAW talks have taken a low profile during the Canadian strike.",

Job security is the key.\"\nContract talks with General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. resumed Monday after meetings late last week between UAW President Stephen Yokich and the automakers' chairmen.\nThe UAW has not yet chosen which company it will negotiate a pattern agreement with. Yokich said last week that he delayed the union's traditional choice of a \"strike target\" to allow the negotiating progress to continue at all three companies.\nA UAW spokesman said no decision on a target company is expected this week.\nTraditionally, the target is threatened with a national strike on the contract expiration date if no agreement is reached by then. The current pact, covering about 400,000 U.S. hourly workers at the three automakers, expires September 14.\nFord spokesman Jon Harmon said the automaker suggested to the UAW about three weeks ago that both sides should examine possibly negotiating a longer-term contract.\nHe said a longer agreement would stabilise Ford's future costs, allowing it to evaluate future product and investment decisions more accurately. \"It gives you more of a known quantity,\" he said.\nYokich has said he would be open to a longer contract if the automakers \"want to buy it.\"\nHowever, many UAW officials remain sceptical about a longer-term pact and say that removal of a strike threat every three years could invite abuses by the automakers.\n\"The question is how can GM live up to a five-year agreement when they can't live up to a three-year agreement?\" said Ed McNulty, president of UAW Local 14 at GM's Toledo, Ohio, truck transmission plant.\nSuch an agreement would have to provide a mechanism for enforcement of the contract and for revisions to resolve local issues over sourcing and staffing levels that are sure to arise over the life of the contract, he said.\nGM has been hit by several strikes at individual plants over the current three-year contract over sourcing and jobs.\n\"You're going to have to have some good job security and outsourcing provisions for the membership to go for it,\" McNulty said.",

The two sides are crafting a complicated agreement that is expected to maintain job guarantees set by Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp, but may exclude a number of GM facilities.  \nNevertheless, analysts say GM is due for an increase because of the company's improving cash position and stronger earnings.\nThe quarterly payout rate on GM's $1-2/3 par-value stock has been unchanged since February, when it was raised to $0.40 a share from $0.30.\nGlantz's anticipation of an increase in the dividend and a possible share buyback program was predicated upon having an agreement in hand.\nLehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi agreed but he noted that GM needs to increase its payout to improve its dividend yield.

Ford results are due October 16.  \nThe strength at Ford largely rides on the fact that it is not paying the enormous product launch costs for the Taurus sedan and F-Series pickup truck that dragged down year-ago results.\nFord also is beginning to reap profits from the F-Series and the Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle, which have brightened the automaker's outlook.\n\"We think Ford's new products will enable it to gain an increased share going forward, and as a result Ford's earnings momentum should continue,\" Blaschke said.  \nFord's profits would have been even better but for losses in Brazil and Argentina that the automaker warned about in September.\nFord is scambling to put its Fiesta small car into production in Brazil following the breakup of the company's Autolatina joint venture with Volkswagen AG in 1995.\nChrysler's third quarter profits, scheduled for release October 14, are expected to increase 41 percent, to about $500 million, or $0.69 a share, from $354 million, or $0.48, a year earlier.\nChrysler also experienced launch problems in the year-ago period in its all-important minivan product lines.\nThis year, it is churning out minivans and Dodge Ram pickup trucks and has raised its share of the U.S. vehicle market to record levels.

UAW Local 95 wants GM to hire more workers in Janesville to reduce the strain of heavy overtime and an increasing workload.\nOn Sunday, members of UAW Local 23 returned to work at a key metal stamping plant in Indianapolis after ratifying a settlement on a new local contract.\nThe union members had struck for five days, shutting off shipments of fenders, doors, hoods and other steel body panels to nine of GM's 11 North American light truck assembly plants.\nBy the weekend, strike-caused parts shortages forced GM to shut down factories in Fort Wayne, Ind., Shreveport, La., Moraine, Ohio, and Linden, N.J.\nGM said the Fort Wayne and Moraine plants are scheduled to resume normal operations Tuesday, while Shreveport and Linden will be running again by Thursday.\nLast week, the UAW walkouts and lingering parts shortages from last month's Canadian Auto Workers strike had idled nearly 38,000 GM workers in the United States.\nGM did not say how many workers were still idle, but added that four car plants stricken by the CAW strike will be back to full production by Tuesday, including Detroit; Lordstown, Ohio; and Lake Orion and Lansing, Mich.\nHealy estimated that between the two walkouts, GM's production losses will total 175,000 cars and trucks, which will slash the company's fourth-quarter profits by $600 million to $650 million.\nIn contrast to the tense atmosphere that continues to surround the GM labour situation, UAW President Stephen Yokich and Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton signed a new three-year contract in an historic ceremony at the union's Detroit headquarters.\nThe signing marked the first time that a Big Three automaker has signed a new labour accord at the UAW's Solidarity House.\nYokich and Eaton were in a jovial mood as they signed the pact -- a stark contrast to the separate, grim-faced news conferences where the UAW and GM announced their deal early Saturday morning.\nYokich told reporters the Chrysler signing \"shows that this company recognises the union and wants to work with them.\"\nMeanwhile, GM declared an unchanged quarterly dividend of 40 cents a share on its $1-2/3 par value common stock.\nSome analysts had expected GM's board of directors to increase the annual payout to $2 a share from $1.60 because of its growing cash pile. But Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi said the board did not want to disrupt the UAW pact's ratification by giving more cash to shareholders.",

Top on the list of such facilities were GM's Janesville, Wis., plant, which makes Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon and Suburban full-size sport/utility vehicles, and the Pontiac, Mich., plant, which makes GM's popular full-size pickup trucks with extended cabs.\nA selective strike at those facilities would inflict pain on GM while minimizing the drain on the UAW's strike fund, which pays each UAW worker $150 a week. It also would blunt some of the political fallout from a massive strike close to the U.S. presidential election.\nUAW officials say the two sides remain at odds over the union's demand that GM follow the pattern set at Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp by guaranteeing employment for 95 percent of its current UAW workforce.\nGM, which has 12 parts plants that it considers uncompetitive, wants to exclude several of those facilities from the guarantee, including a door hardware plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that it wants to sell.\nIn settling the Canadian strike last week, GM was able to secure a deal that included the selling of two parts plants in Windsor and Oshawa, Ontario and retained some flexibility to outsource more products. However, GM agreed to guarantee pensions for workers in the two plants or up to nine years and to allow them to transfer back to jobs that open up in other GM facilities.\nGM still has more than 20,000 workers in the United States and Mexico idled because of lingering parts shortages associated with the Canadian strike.",

But some analysts believe it is only a matter of time before the U.S. scenario widens its impact and is repeated across the Atlantic.\n\"If it happens in the U.S. it's subsequently followed in other countries,\" said Zafar Khan, analyst at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull.\n\"Imperial could have been a ripe international takeover candidate. But the litigation threat means a group buying a tobacco company would have a tough time selling the idea to shareholders now,\" he said.\nUBS analysts agree that the threat of legal action is enough to dampen the company's outlook.\nBut they warn of another possible dampener on the stock when Imperial starts trading - its heavy reliance on Britain, largely seen as a mature market. Britain accounts for 87 percent of profits, say analysts.\nImperial has already committed itself to overseas expansion, but there are fears that it will have a tough time muscling in on the U.S. giants which have already made inroads into the markets of tomorrow - India, China and the Far East.\n\"We see investor concerns on litigation risk combined with the uncertain outlook in the key UK market as implying a 20-30 percent PE (price earnings) discount to the UK average.\" This assumes a prospective PE of 9.9 times, UBS said in a note.\nIt has given Hanson a total break-up value of 164 pence, in a market range of 150 to 200 pence per share. Hanson shares were down 2 1/2 pence at 159 1/2 by 1033 GMT Friday.\nUBS specifically values the Imperial constituent at 39 pence per share or 2.03 billion pounds ($3.14 billion).\nHowever, another investment analyst who declined to be named, said he was more upbeat on Imperial's prospects.\n\"It's a clean business. It could become a takeover target and it's also very cash generative,\" he said.\nHe values Imperial at 37 pence in a total Hanson break-up valuation of 187 pence per share.\nThere is some upside to the Imperial story. Apart from being viewed as a highly efficient player and being the second biggest UK tobacco company with 38 percent of the market, it is also poised to try and tap the vast emerging markets.\nGareth Davis (corrects from Nigel Davis), Imperial's chief executive who joined the company straight from university, told the London-based Evening Standard newspaper earlier this week that he believed the group would continue to build up exports to Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\"Worldwide this industry is buoyant,\" he said.\nImperial has said in earlier mission statements that it will expand abroad through \"organic growth and acquisition.\"",

The 10,600-ton ship has the added protection of blastproof safety glass.\nThe Russians will provide the Zenit rockets, chosen because they can be assembled horizontally on board the command ship.\nBoeing will provide project management, marketing services and run the operation for liftoff.\nAsked about the risk of explosion Johnsen said, \"The risk of explosion is very much related to this business. But we think that risk is very low. There are built-in safety features and it's a very sound operation from an insurance point of view.\"\nIgnition to release of the rocket takes 4.6 seconds, with emissions from the rocket on takeoff channelled sideways.\n\"If the emissions didn't go sideways, the pressure could shift the platform,\" he said, which weighs 23,000 tons.\nConfidence in the system, a world-first, has been demonstrated by a rash of early contracts.\nHughes Space and Communications International Inc. of Los Angeles has 10 launches signed. Space Systems/Loral, also from California has five booked.\nThe groups involved have refused to comment on how much they will charge per launch or on potential profits, with Kvaerner's Johnson only stating that its slice will be \"a good return on our investment.\"\nIt will be able to fire six to eight rockets a year. The idea was originally conceived by Boeing, which had intended to fire satellites from a supertanker.\nBut the danger involved made the platform idea more appealing, allowing evacuation before blastoff.",

We will assess each new idea on its merit.\"\nHe said any move into military vehicles would have to be cleared with shareholders first, \"...for ethical as well as commercial reasons,\" he said.\nOn the subject of leasing out frontline tanks, Cowie was more cautious, admitting that there had been \"No talks with the MOD. But it has said that under PFI (private finance initiative) there aren't any no-go areas,\" said Blower.\nThe PFI scheme, applied across all government departments, aims to bring private cash into public spending projects including the option of the government leasing equipment. But an MOD spokesman was highly sceptical. Asked whether the MOD would put out a PFI project for tank leasing, he said\n\"Emphatically not. In broad terms the PFI rules nothing out and nothing in. Cowie has won a contract (with us) for forklift trucks and that is not. There is nothing else on the cards, let alone tanks.\"\nCowie announced on Wednesday it had won a material handling equipment leasing contract with the MOD.\nTank and transportation equipment manufacturers like Vickers Plc were sceptical about reports of expanding leasing to military vehicles.\nA Vickers spokeswoman told Reuters it did not approach Cowie and described the idea of leasing battle tanks as \"fairly off the wall. Leasing trucks is one things, but a battle tank is quite another,\" she said.\nBut GKN was more circumspect. Asked whether it had approached anyone about the idea of forming a leasing venture to supply the MOD or other markets, a spokeswoman said \"There are no discussions at this stage.\"\nU.S. giants have already caught onto the concept, with world leaders like Lockheed Martin and McDonald Douglas exploring the possibility of leasing military aircraft to Eastern European countries.\nAt 1159 GMT Cowie shares were down nearly two pence at 372-3/4p in a generally weaker British stock market.",

But it's when it gets to the (employee) families -- that it goes across the line.\"\nTactics used by some underground groups including the cryptic Berkshire Wood Elves, which distribute leaflets with instructions on home-made explosives, are now the subject of a police investigation.\nOther larger activist groups include Earth First, The Land is Ours, Alarm UK and Road Alert.\nThe groups have targeted specific projects like the Newbury bypass and the M3 motorway through Twyford Down in the southern county of Hampshire.\nBut they are also campaigning on broader issue such as stopping the government road building programme and out-of-town superstores which they say create more traffic, pollution and damage local communities.\nThe government has slashed its road-building spending. Although protests may have contributed to the decision it has been seen primarily as economic rather than ecological.\nGraham Watts, chief executive of the Construction Industry Council, said :\"I don't think many firms involved in tendering for sensitive projects realise the impact environmental activity has on the cost of running a project.\n\"But they are more alert than they were 3-4 years ago. There's no doubt it's a big issue now.\"\nHe says the damage comes in two forms: \"Tangible -- in the form of extra costs, additional security, threats to staff and the more intangible damage caused by negative publicity.\"\nWatts said the cost of protesting can be heavy once the company is locked into a contract.\n\"I do often hear on the industry circuit of tales where the company tenders at low margins and the demonstrations which follow means they are running the project at a loss.\"\nARC says it's not just contractors in the front line but also suppliers like itself.\nIts own quarries came under attack after it emerged that it may be a supplier for the Newbury bypass.\n\"It was called the \"First Battle of the Newbury bypass',\" said ARC's Harding.\n\"We had 300 Earth First protestors invade and occupy our site. Hundreds of thousands of pounds (dollars) of damage was done in one day. Plus there was the knock-on cost of lost production and extra security in future.\"\nSimon Brown, analyst at investement bank UBS, said this new phenomenon has led to a change in the way the industry evaluates project risk.\n\"When talking to Tarmac about the M3 link (through Twyford Down) they made it fairly clear that their risk assessment methods have been changed and now involve a very clear environmental risk analysis.\"\nHarding says others have done the same. \"As a result of eco-terrorism we are looking at controversial jobs more closely to see if the profit margins are wide enough to cover things like extra security.\"\nFor an industry already suffering from razor-thin margins, overcapacity and stagnant demand, eco-terrorism is the latest bizarre twist in the construction sector's tale of woe.",

It also faces the cost of compensating passengers and tranferring them by air or ferry.\nA Eurotunnel spokesman said all these costs should be covered by insurance, however.\n\"It will have very little impact,\" said one analyst. \"Transport disasters are always newsworthy but the bad publicity will soon fade away. Eurotunnel will be financially damaged, but you have to look at it in relation to the nine billion of debt.\"\nThe ferries have been scooping up extra business from big freight customers like TNT, which said it would be using the ferries more as a result of the tunnel fire.\nAndrew Darke, analyst at Williams de Broe, said \"There's clearly going to be some emotional reaction, but I expect it to be short-lived. After all passenger numbers rose after the Herald of Free Enterprise (ferry) disaster nine years ago.\n\"Disasters don't stop people travelling. People still go shopping in London despite IRA bombs,\" he said.\nEurotunnel had around 45 percent of the cross-Channel ferry market before the fire -- a share won partly by waging a cut-throat price-war with the ferries, which have since proposed linking up to battle against their tunnel rival.\nSwedish ferry giant Stena Line and P&O agreed to merge in October and are awaiting clearance from competition bodies.\nDarke said P&O's chances of clearance had been boosted by the tunnel disaster. The verdict is due later this month.",

We are a growth company,\" Landuyt said, warning investors of a tight dividend policy.\nThe demerger of Hanson Plc will create four companies - Millennium, Imperial Tobacco, Energy Group and the rump building firm which will retain the famous Hanson name.\nAs investors await details of the float of the first two divisions - Millennium and Imperial - Landuyt said there had been takeover interest in all four companies including his own empire.\n\"We've had interest for every business in Hanson.\" He said \"expressions of interest\" included those for whole divisions as well as individual companies within each of the four divisions to be floated off.\nMillennium itself received approaches for all three of its units - Quantum, SCM and Glidco. All approaches were rebuffed.\nHanson's chemicals arm had been widely tipped as a takeover candidate by analysts in recent months, but Hanson's group share price recently took a hit after it was revealed that Millennium had built in a \"poison pill\" to deter predators.\nThe move led to a downgrading in the Hanson break-up value by analysts including BZW which pared back to 193 from 207 pence per share. The market valuation range spreads from 150 pence to 200 pence per share. Hanson's shares stand at 162 1/4, up 2 3/4 pence.\nOne analyst said of the poison pill episode \"It was quite disgusting. Here is a predatory company which has spoken out against such tactics and has installed a poison pill itself.\"\nBut Landuyt said it was vital to prevent a predator buying up shares on the cheap and launching an undervalued bid.\n\"We do expect selling pressure (for Millennium shares) for at least the first six months. We don't want a temporary drop in the share price to allow someone to get a commanding position and launch a bid which does not offer full value.\"\nUnder law in the U.S. state of Delaware, a company gaining a 15 percent stake in Millennium would see those shares become worthless. They would carry no vote or liquidation value unless the board had been approached first.\nBut the poison pill clause ends after one year, said the chemicals company chief, freeing the way for a possible bid.\nAnother factor which has damped Millennium's core valuation has been poor trading which has dogged the chemicals market leading to plant closures and asset writedowns of $60 million at SCM. Landuyt said that a further $15 million charge still had to be levied.\nHe said the impact on trading profits would be neutral and also said signs of an uptick remain.\nHe expected SCM to be able to make its October price increases stick after heavy destocking by customers.\nQuantum's recently reported improvement in pricing and demand also continues, he said.",

Its brands include Embassy, John Player Special and Superkings cigarettes as well as Panama and Castella cigars.\nIt is one of four arms of the mighty Hanson conglomerate being spun off into separate companies.\nIn the 10 years since Hanson took over Imperial, it has slashed costs, cut its brands to 33 from 150 and raised productivity by 195 percent.

Given our cash flow characteristics people tend to say \"What are you going to do with all that cash.'\"\nImperial reports its first set of results since the Hanson demerger on December 5 when it will give a trading update of the first few months since its split.\nDavis said he expected the British market to continue to decline at around two percent next year.\nBut the international business, accounting for 17 percent of profits in the first eight months of the year, is expected to show continued rapid growth.\n\"I would be very disappointed if it wasn't 25 percent by 2000.\" The last two years have seen overseas sales double, but Davis drew the line at hitting his target by 1997.\n\"That would be overstating it (our confidence).

In the intervening decade, the company has won billions of dollars in additional royalties, a spokesman said.\nTexas Instruments said it expected Samsung to pay it about $105 million in the fourth quarter for \"catch-up royalties\" covering the first nine months of 1996 when the companies were battling in court.\nAnalysts said the \"catch up\" payments should substantially boost earnings for the quarter ending in December, but the gain will be offset by a charge for an undisclosed amount the company plans to take for an early retirmement programme.\nKurlak estimated Texas Instruments will see $35 million in additional quarterly royalties going forward as a result of the Samsung deal, but that is down from the roughly $85 million it received quarterly from Samsung at the end of 1995.\nWith this deal, Texas Instruments said it has almost completed its 1995 round of patent cross-license agreements with major semiconductor makers.\nEarlier in the year, Texas Instruments reached 10-year deals with Fujitsu Ltd., Oki Electric Industry Co.

The company's total headcount stands at about 3,200 worldwide.\nIn a telephone interview, CompuServe spokesman Steve Conway maintained that while his company was abandoning further mass marketing efforts aimed at U.S. consumers, \"If you are currently a subscriber, you will not notice a change.\"  \nNontheless, the Columbus, Ohio-based company said it would focus its efforts and investments going forward on business and professional markets, its traditional selling point.\nBesides defending its core online services customer base, they said CompuServe will focus on other profitable operations like its network systems infrastructure unit, which generates 30 percent of total revenues.\nIn disbanding its Wow! service, the company blamed new market entrants, or Internet service providers, pricing competition and the high costs of consumer marketing.\nThe company announced plans to launch early next year a new \"CompuServe for Business\" serivce, an enhanced version of its core CompuServe Interactive with a new software interface and added content from \"thousands\" of information providers.  \nDespite a series of missteps in the United States, growth remains robust overseas, where CompuServe's brand is the best recognized name among online and Internet access providers.\nConway said CompuServe Interactive's service has nearly doubled in its number of subscribers in Europe during the past 12 months, rising to more than 800,000 from about 450,000. \"It's a growing market for these services, and we outpaced the market,\" he said.\nAbout 60 percent of CompuServe's European customers are for business, professional and technical users, while 40 percent fall in the consumer category, Conway said.\nThat's roughly the inverse of North America, where about 55 percent of CompuServe's main service are consumers.\nThe 800,000 customers represent the bulk of CompuServe's international base, which totaled 1.12 million at October 31.\nThe Wow! service had been introduced only seven months ago to much fanfare, but failed to get off the ground.\nCompuServe Vice President Scott Kaufman, the man in charge of developing the Wow! service, promised at the time Wow! was lauched to carpet bomb consumers with free software disks promoting the new service.\n\"They'll be falling out of cereal boxes,\" he had vowed at the time.",

Iomega said the n-hand disks are about half the size of a business card.\nSeveral industry analysts said they believe Iomega's technology could help propel digital cameras into the consumer mainstream within a matter of years, by freeing users from the fixed capacity of existing flash memory storage and by substantially reducing the overall cost of such cameras.\nA digital camera could store from 50 to 80 images on a single $10 n-hand disk, Iomega said, depending on image resolution. Consumers now pay hundreds of dollars for a flash memory card capable of holding the same number of images, it noted.\nJim Porter, a data storage analyst with market research firm Disk/Trend Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., said the Iomega technology could cut the cost of storing photographs by a factor of 20 times.\nA Kodak digital camera costing $499 currently could be priced as low as $300 within a matter of years, he said, reflecting the elimination of more costly digital storage methods.\nIomega's plans pose a theat to makers of flash memory chips that are used to store digital information in such small electronic devices currently. Leading makers including Sandisk Corp., Intel Corp. and Toshiba Corp.\nIn addition, the Iomega system could help accelerate the current digital transformation of the camera industry, leading to a decline in revenues that cameramakers receive from conventional silver halide-based photo film and equipment.\n\"With 'n-hand' you have a digital camera that you can treat like a regular camera,\" Meyer said, referring to the replaceable nature of the Iomega high-density floppy disk system.\n\"This technology can make digital cameras much more competitive with regular ones,\" he said.\nBesides lacking a low-cost removable storage medium, digital cameras offer inferior picture quality but image resolution is improving rapidly, analysts said. This could lead to explosive growth of the new cameras in coming years.\nShares of the company closed up $1.375 to $25.375 on active trading on Nasdaq. On Friday, Iomega's stock will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange.",

The stock rose after Wednesday's announcement because new CompuServe shares still owned by H&R Block will not come onto the market.\nCompuServe added 93.75 cents to $13.25 on Nasdaq, while H&R Block fell $2.125 to $25.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. America Online added 75 cents to $31.625, also on Nasdaq.\nIn July, CompuServe shocked Wall Street with a warning that it expected a loss for its first quarter ended July 31, its first as a publicly traded company.\nThe company blamed the high costs of introducing its new Wow! consumer online service and investing in an overhaul of its network infrastructure, as well as a decline in overall subscriber growth as cancellations outpaced new customers.\nIn response, CompuServe and H&R Block were slapped with a shareholder lawsuit alleging they had misrepresented the online service's prospects in the prospectus for the stock offering.\nWhen the company last week reported a first-quarter loss of $29.6 million, or 32 cents a share, it also warned investors that losses would continue for the second quarter ending in October.\nH&R Block, which is also the nation's largest consumer tax filing service, is likely to wait for the online industry to settle down before completing the spin-off, analysts said.\nIn addition to the losses, H&R Block cited the planned introduction next month of new technology for CompuServe and its new Wow! service.\nMeanwhile, America Online has had problems of its own, including price cuts to stay competitive with Internet access providers and an embarrassing 19-hour service blackout earlier this month. But analysts said that in contrast to CompuServe, America Online has continued to grow, though at a slower pace.\n\"The problems CompuServe is having are likely to benefit America Online in the next nine months,\" one analyst said.",

The stock was up $2.25 to $97.50 in late afternoon trading after earlier climbing as much as $3.25.\nA GE spokesman declined to comment on Welch's remarks to analysts. He said the company had gone on record in its third-quarter earnings report, released Oct. 10, as being on track for a \"record year\" in 1996.\nThe spokesman confirmed, however, that GE's board would meet on Friday.\nAfter the meeting, CS First Boston said analyst Martin Sankey reiterated his strong buy recommendation on GE's stock and boosted his 1997 earnings estimate 5 cents to $5 per share.\n\"They are looking for good progress next year,\" Leavitt said, adding that while little new was disclosed at the twice-yearly briefing, \"There seems to be a high level of conviction that progress is in place.\"\nWelch specifically cited a turnaround in the company's power businesses and strong growth in its NBC broadcasting unit, Leavitt said.\n\"You've got everything pretty much clicking in the company,\" said NatWest Securites analyst Nicholas Heyman, who also attended the meeting. He said Welch spoke of 13 percent earnings growth for both the current year and for 1997.\nMore good news could come as early as Friday, when GE's board of directors is scheduled to meet.\nAt that meeting, several analysts said they believed the board will authorise a two-for-one split of GE shares and increase its authorisation to buy back the company's shares to $13 billion from its current level of $9 billion.\nCompany share buybacks increase the value of remaining shares by decreasing the number of shares outstanding, a move looked on with favour by investors, since the underlying value of each share held increases.\nIn addition, NatWest's Heyman said he expected the board to boost the stock's annual dividend by 13 percent to $2.08 from its current level of $1.84 per share.\nSince early 1995, General Electric's stock has proven one of Wall Street's best perfomers, more than doubling in value.\n\"Most of the Wall Street analysts came away comfortable that the earnings estimates will be realised this year and next year,\" one fund manager said of the meeting with Welch. \"It's his usual magic with Wall Street.\"",

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nPersonal communications services represent the new generation of celluar communications services, allowing customers to send both voice and data transmissions over wireless telephones.\nThe deal will help underpin the financial future of debt-laden NextWave, which was the largest bidder in the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's auctions for \"C-band\" wireless radio spectrum held in early July.\nNextWave, based in San Diego and New York, also plans to sell stock to the public.\nFor MCI, the deal enables it to expand quickly into the rapidly growing market for wireless personal communications services.\nTwo years ago, MCI dropped out of the auctions for U.S. PCS licences after the bidding became too rich for its taste.\nBut with the NextWave pact and previous smaller deals, MCI has moved to become a major reseller of wireless services.\nAs part of the deal, NextWave selected MCI to provide telecommunications and other services supporting the development and ongoing operations of its personal communications services system, MCI said.\n\"This agreement with NextWave establishes an immediate nationwide PCS footprint for MCI and represents an important next step in MCI's wireless strategy,\" said Whitey Bluestein, vice president for MCI wireless strategy and development.\n\"This is the first full interconnection agreement of its kind and brings new competition to the wireless marketplace,\" he said, noting that with full interconnection, MCI does not need to own its own wireless facilities.\nMCI said the NextWave agreement is a model for additional agreements it expects to sign with other wireless providers as part of its wireless interconnected network strategy.\nThe strategy is MCI's blueprint for developing a full range of wireless services and features that will be integrated into MCI's existing communications services.\n\"This was MCI's strategy all along,\" said Jeffrey Kagan, an Atlanta-based telecommunications industry analyst.\nKagan said MCI has historically preferred to resell communications services initially rather than investing in its own infrastructure. Over time, the company selectively builds its own infrastructure as it proves profitable to do so.\n\"Reselling service was how they became a heavy hitter in long distance in the first place,\" Kagan said. \"What their plan is, is to resell service from other providers and build networks where they see the need to do so,\" he said.\nKagan said MCI's deal with NextWave marks the rapid realisation of its reseller strategy. \"This all of a sudden puts MCI on the wireless communications map in a big way.\"\nStill, he noted that AT&T Corp.'s AT&T Wireless unit, the former McCaw Cellular business, remains twice as large as MCI's cellular business, with about 6.5 million subscribers in geographic regions covering 207 million potential customers.\nMCI's deal with NextWave covers about 110 million potential customers living in a mix of metropolitan and less-densely populated areas.\nMCI's stock traded at $25.25 a share Monday, down 25 cents, on Nasdaq.",

The company's total head count stands at about 3,200 worldwide.\nThe company laid off 150 employees, or 4 percent of its work force, in an earlier cutback announced last summer.\nCompuServe's moves come on the heels of recent aggressive actions by rival America Online Inc. to stay on top by offering a series of new pricing options, including a flat monthly rate of $19.95, and by shutting down its direct Internet access service.\nSince CompuServe's parent, H&R Block Inc., sold 20 percent of the online service to the public in April, CompuServe has struggled to keep up with America Online, the largest online service, and with a host of Internet-based competitors.\nAmerica Online has more than 7 million subscribers. As of Oct. 31, CompuServe said it had 3.3 million direct worldwide subscribers. NiftyServe, its Japanese licensee, had a total of 5.3 million, roughly the same level as in July.\nIn reaction to CompuServe's continuing troubles, H&R Block in August shelved plans to spin off the 80 percent of CompuServe it still owns.\nSince CompuServe's initial public stock offering in April, its prospects have dimmed, with its stock tumbling from an initial price of $30 a share. The stock fell 94 cents Thursday to $10.69 on Nasdaq.\nEarlier Thursday, H&R reported a substantial loss for its second quarter ended Oct. 31, citing CompuServe's turmoil.\nKrasilovsky said CompuServe's plan to go back to basics was \"very realistic,\" but added \"too bad they didn't do it a year-and-a-half ago.\"\nThe analyst said he expects the company to reposition itself to provide niche services to business customers who don't want to pay for a high-level premium online service.\nIn a telephone interview, CompuServe spokesman Steve Conway said that while his company was abandoning further mass-marketing efforts aimed at U.S. consumers, \"If you are currently a subscriber, you will not notice a change.\"\nNontheless, the Columbus, Ohio-based company said it would target its efforts and investments at business and professional users, its traditional strength.\nWow! was introduced seven months ago to much fanfare, but failed to get off the ground. Wow! customers numbered 102,000 at latest count, the company said.\nThe company blamed the failure of Wow! on new market entrants, or Internet service providers, pricing competition and the high costs of consumer marketing.\nThe company also said it plans to launch early next year a new \"CompuServe for Business\" service, an enhanced version of its core CompuServe Interactive with a new interface and added content from \"thousands\" of information providers.\nDespite a series of missteps in the United States, growth remains robust overseas where CompuServe's brand is the best recognised name among online and Internet access providers.\nIn Europe, for example, CompuServe said subscribers to its main CompuServe Interactive online service had nearly doubled to more than 800,000 in the past year.",

        "Text": "Intel Corp shares slid another four points on Friday, continuing a three-day retreat triggered by smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc's statement that its turnaround plan is on track.\nBut analysts and money managers were unruffled by what they said was profit-taking in Intel and a temporary shift among some momentum investors to AMD and away from Intel.\nIntel stock has lost about six percent of its value since Wednesday, when Advanced Micro said it was sampling its Pentium-like K6 chip, which its expect to ship in early 1997.  \nIntel closed at 115-7/8, down 4, on volume of 15 million shares, marking it as the most active Nasdaq stock. Intel, a key component in the Nasdaq Composite index, has acted as a drag on the market even as the NYSE has hit new record highs.\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 1261.81, off 8.55.\nEdwin Turney, a Silicon Valley-based technology money manager who runs the Panagea fund, agreed, saying: \"You have a lot of profit-taking and then you have got the momentum players who have had a hell of a run in the last 6 months.\n\"So now they are looking at the secondary players,\" Turney said, referring specifically to Advanced Micro.  \n\"AMD has been a catalyst for other people to take profit,\" agreed Merrill Lynch semiconductor analyst Thomas Kurlak.\n\"There is really nothing specifically to explain (Intel's recent decline). It's just another wiggle in the chart.\"\nSoundview President James Townsend agreed AMD's announcement may have provided an excuse for some investors to temporarily shift out of Intel.\n\"With a stock that has been this incredibly successful, it may be enough to take some profits off the table,\" Townsend said. He was referring to Intel's impressive 50 point rise to new record levels since mid-summer.  \nAMD stock has languished in recent years after repeated failures to match Intel's Pentium technology. However, since Wednesday, the stock has gained more than 20 percent. It closed at 25-1/8, up 1/2 point on the day on Friday.\nAnalysts said AMD's new K6 chips are not compatible with Intel latest Pentium Pro chips, but the chip could do a healthy business as a simple Pentium alternative.\n\"There's clearly room enough for both companies to do well,\" said C.B. Lee, an analyst at Hancock Institutional Partners, who follows both Intel and AMD.  \n\"Clearly, AMD has had some impact in the minds of some investors,\" Lee said of Intel's declines in recent days, but added: \"In my mind AMD is not a threat.\"\nAnalysts expect Intel to produce 20 million Pentium microprocessors in the current quarter, while AMD will build only a tiny fraction of that number -- and less powerful processers at that.\nLike most chip sector securities analysts, Kurlak maintains a strong buy on Intel and a neutral rating on AMD.\nLee said he also remains neutral on AMD, \"but its back in my good graces\" with its plans to introduce the K6 chip.\nIn the last week, Prudential Securities analyst Mark Edelstone was alone among Wall Street analysts in upgrading AMD to a buy from a hold in response to the K6 announcement.",

        "Text": "Microcom Inc and Rockwell Semiconductor Systems said Wednesday they plan to beef up their technology partnership to speed development of higher speed 56-kilobit modems for central switch equipment.\nThe 56 kilobit modems would allow computer users to connect to the Internet at speeds nearly double the rate of current 28.8 kilobit modems now available using standard phone lines.\nThe deal builds on a decade-old product development partnership between Microcom and Rockwell. Rockwell Semiconductor is a unit of Rockwell International Corp.  \nNew Microcom central site switch equipment would give the receiving end -- phone carriers, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and corporate central offices -- the capacity to handle incoming calls from computers with 56 kilobit modems.\n\"It increases the market scope of Rockwell's 56k offering,\" said Prudential analyst Jim Thayer of Rockwell's 56 kilobit modem plans. He maintains a buy rating on Microcom.\nHowever, Hambrecht & Quist analyst Rakesh Sood said the Microcom/Rockwell pact was a defensive response to a U.S. Robotics Inc initiative already well under way by the company to offer its own set of 56 kilobit modem products.  \nIn the Rockwell/Microcom pact, Rockwell will contribute its K56Plus modem chipset to the venture, while Microcom will offer its Modemware technology, a software interface that other equipment providers license to build their own modems.\nTo speed 56k development, Rockwell said it is opening an East Coast development center with 15 to 20 Rockwell engineers working alongside Microcom staff. The center will initially be at Microcom's headquarters in Norwood, Massachusetts. Rockwell is based in Seal Beach, Calif.  \nAs part of the partnership, Rockwell and Microcom are working together to drive standards development of a new high speed modem standard that would incorporate Microcom's MNP (Microcom Networking Protocol) standard.\nModems based on the Rockwell chip design would not be compatible with those from Robotics until an industry-wide standard for compatability can be hammered out, which no industry player seriously expects before 1998.  \nIn the intervening period, modems based on Rockwell's standard will work only with central office switches from partners such as Microcom, while Robotics modems will work only with equipment offered by backers of its standard.\nU.S. Robotics has licensed its X2 56 kilobit technology to chipmakers Texas Instruments Inc and Cirrus Logic Inc and to modem supplier Cardinal Technologies Inc CRTK.O.\nRobotics plans to introduce 56 kilobit modems in January and remote access equipment in February, a spokeswoman said.\nRockwell's own 56 kilobit plans have been slower getting off the ground, but the company has said it too plans to introduce new 56k modems in the first quarter of 1997.  \nNonetheless, Rockwell's technology has been embraced by Ascend Communications Inc and consumer modem makers Boca Research Inc, Hayes Microcomputer Inc and Zoom Telephonics Inc, who are unhappy doing business with rival U.S. Robotics Inc, the dominant consumer modem supplier.\nMicrocom said it plans to incorporate the Rockwell K56Plus technology into central site modem systems that it sells both directly and indirectly, through partnerships with Cisco Systems Inc, Bay Networks Inc, Digital Equipment Corp and Gandalf Technologies INc.  \nMicrocom officials said they expect Rockwell/Microcom modems to be adopted by many network equipment makers who fear relying on Robotics, which is seen as a competitive threat.\nMicrocom said products based the Rockwell design will be available for test and evaluation early in 1997 and that finished products will ship in central site and remote modem equipment by late in the first quarter of 1997.\nThayer argued the schism over standards should buy time for the Rockwell camp and may allow it to gain market share from Robotics due to Rockwell's wider base of support.\n\"They should have a fairly high share of 56 kilobit market over time,\" Thayer said of the Rockwell/Microcom partnership.\nHowever, Sood argues the market for 56 kilobit modems will come largely from home computer users not office workers, who have access to other high-speed communications alternatives.\nThis plays to U.S. Robotics' strength as an equipment supplier to a majority of the top 10 Internet access providers aimed at consumers, like America Online Inc and Netcom On-line Communications Inc, Sood said.",

        "Text": "Promising the computer industry equivalent of universal harmony, a U.S.-based start-up formed by a brain trust of Israeli computer scientists Monday unveiled a technology that promises to overcome barriers dividing users of rival software programs.\nAnysoft Inc. said its set of software technologies allows computer users to manipulate information from any application while retaining all formatting and other properties.\nThe system functions as an underlying layer of operating system software, but independent of any one operating system. An operating system controls the basic functions of a computer. Anysoft officials asserted the system can handle text, numerical data, graphical images, video and other data, including information available only at remote Internet sites.\n\"This is the beginning of true software interoperability,\" Anysoft Chief Executive Illan Poreh said in a statement. \"For the first time, all applications, including those that have not incorporated the ANY Technologies, will work together.\"\nThe private Cambridge, Mass.-based firm is backed by Bank Leumi, Israel's largest bank, and 21 private investors, including several senior executives at modem maker U.S. Robotics Corp..\nIn an interview, Anysoft founder Poreh said the company's team of software programmers was handpicked from among top professors and graduate students at leading Israeli universities, including Technion, the Israeli Institute of Technology.\nIndustry analysts briefed on the technology hailed it as a decisive breakthrough, based on its potential to liberate computer users from dependence on any single operating system, such as Microsoft Corp.'s Windows.\n\"This is certainly one of the most significant technologies I've seen in the past five years,\" said veteran industry analyst Tim Bajarin, who heads Creative Strategies, a San Jose, Calif.-based consulting firm.\n\"What Anysoft has done is taken software interoperability beyond a forced Windows-X86 environment,\" Barjarin said, referring to the ruling combination of Microsoft software and Intel Corp. software and hardware systems.\nNonetheless, Anysoft's audacious goal is set against a history of failed industry attempts to create a universally accepted format capable of handling all types of computer data.\nIn recent years, leading computer makers like International Business Machines Corp., Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. have rallied around a common software compabability standard known as CORBA.\nHowever, this and similar initiatives have been hamstrung by competitive rivalries among industry players and the belief that programmers must unify around a single standard for creating software.\nMicrosoft's own effort at ushering in a \"Golden Age\" of software compatability has gone by several names, such as Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), and ActiveX, its Internet-based compatability standard.\nBut Microsoft's efforts have met with foot-dragging by companies unwilling to cede the software giant any more standard-setting power than it already has.\nBy contrast, the ANY concept is based on the seemingly simple idea that the only univeral information from different operating systems is what computer users see displayed on a screen.\n\"The screen is the only standard that everyone is using,\" Poreh maintained.\nAnysoft has created software extensions that give computer users the perception of compatibility without having to address underlying programming differences that have ensnared previous efforts, he said.\nAnysoft's go-it-alone strategy depends on seeding its technology widely among software companies, Internet service providers and large corporations developing their own software applications, all of which might include Anysoft's universal data routing features in their own products.\nConsumers would have to wait until products using the technology become available from these companies.\nPoreh said he plans to charge companies using Anysoft technology in their products a licensing fee starting at around $20,000 and running up to $400,000, depending on the potential number of users of the product.\nIn addition, Poreh said Anysoft plans to ask for a royalty of 1 percent to 3 percent, or a flat fee, again depending on the potential number of customers.\nANY technology is designed to extend software systems such as Windows or Lotus Notes, and existing compatibility programs such as Adobe Systems Inc.'s  Acrobat, Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java or even the Internet, rather than replace them, Anysoft officials said.\nAnysoft said it has held licensing talks with five of the world's top 10 independent software development companies, including IBM.\nPoreh said IBM's main interest appeared to be in using ANY technology to recover data from so-called \"legacy\" applications running on older mainframe computers where the underlying software is no longer being actively maintained.\nANY technology currently works with software running on Microsoft's Windows operating systems. The technology is in the process of being made compatible with Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh, IBM's OS/2 and the Unix-based X/Windows operating system, company officials said.",

And like many of those names, Ingram is seen as the undisputed leader in its own industry.\nIts main customers are not end-users of technology products, but the middlemen of distribution -- corporate resellers, systems intergrators and computer retailers.  \n\"Ingram's got it all: distribution power, brand quality and customer or franchise loyalty,\" Shah said.\nUnderlying excitement about the new stock is a belief that Ingram is positioned to benefit directly from a multi-year computer buying boom expected to take hold later this year or early in 1997 and last for anywhere from two to four years.\nCompanies are preparing to upgrade to faster Intel Pentium PCs running Microsoft Windows NT and buy a host of related products made passible by the more powerful machines.  \nIn one important respect, however, Ingram should not be classified with other top technology names famous for their explosive earnings growth and spiraling stock prices.\nIngram competes in a brutal low-margin business that has more in common with supermarkets or trucking than computers -- its profit margins have in fact declined to 6.8 percent in the first half of 1996 from 8.1 percent in 1993.\nThe company's path to Wall Street has not been without its detours and mishaps.  \nAn anticipated public offering was temporarily derailed earlier in the year when Linwood \"Chip\" Lacy -- the engineer credited with driving Ingram Micro's growth over the years -- resigned as chairman and chief executive.\nIngram located a prominent replacement in Jerre Stead, the former head of mainframe software maker Legent Corp. until its 1995 acqusition by Computer Associates International Inc. It named Michael Grainger chief finacial officer two weeks ago.\nBut any Ingram doubters will remain on the sidelines Thursday.  \n\"It is definitely one of the best offerings of the year. There is great demand,\" said Shah for shares of the stock. \"I think it will remain strong and by the end of year, it could be a $30 stock,\" he added.  \nIn an industry known for its love of jargon, computer business insiders speak with a mix of reverential awe about \"the Channel\" - short for distribution channel and the delivery mechanism that has make-or-break control over the future of any computer product.\nIngram is to \"the Channel\" what Microsoft is to software, Intel is to microprocessors and Cisco is to networking.",

        "Text": "AT&T Corp's decision to name outsider John Walter as heir to Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Allen boils down to a basic gamble the company believes it must take to prepare for the torrent of competition ahead.\nThe nation's largest phone company rejected the standard telecoms pedigree shared by most top executives in the industry -- including Allen -- in favor of a more general set of business leadership skills Walter has demonstrated.  \nWednesday, AT&T said Walter, until recently the chief executive of commercial printer R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co, would replace Allen as CEO and chairman in 18 months.\n\"The magnitude of the challenge has got to be at least of the same magnitude as the one that IBM faced,\" said Robert Miles, a top corporate turnaround consultant and author of a forthcoming book of case studies called, \"Corporate Comeback.\"\nBut analysts who followed his tenure at Donnelley credited Walter with being a tough-minded visionary who successfully guided the expansion of his commercial publishing firm into a computer-savvy marketing services firm.  \n\"Walter understands how to run a business and make money,\" said Frank Dzubeck, president of Communcations Network Architects, a Washington, D.C.-based technology consulting firm.\nAt Donnelley, he closed businesses which could not carry their own weight. Earlier this year Donnelley spun off direct mailer Metromail Corp and is planning the spinoff of Donnelley Enterprise Solutions Inc, a provider of information management services to large law firms and investment bank.\nThis crucible of experience will come in handy for Walter at AT&T as the giant company undergoes a similarly wrenching business and technology transition, but on a massive scale.  \nWalter is certainly not without his critics on Wall Street. Financial analysts must be convinced he can scale his Donnelley lessons upward to address $80 billion-a-year AT&T. Donnelley had 1995 revenues of $6.5 billion.\nWednesday, SBC Warburg analyst Barry Sine cut his rating on AT&T to hold from buy, citing disappointment about the naming of Walter to lead the company. \"In our view what was needed was a fresh face with a high-tech resume,\" he said.\nDonnelley's growth came at a price, other analysts added, noting how despite Walter's visionary style the publisher struggled with falling earnings and restructuring issues.  \n\"A lot of things have been going wrong,\" said one analyst, citing the lower earnings outlook and falling stock price. The stock price has performed listlessly recently, trading near its 52-week lows. The stock Thursday was at 38-1/8, up 1/4.\nStill, several analysts classified Walter among the new breed of top technology managers who earn their stripes as sophisticated consumers of technology but who know how to delegate decisions about the nuts and bolts of technology.  \nPerhaps the most famous example of this type is an executive like Louis Gerstner, who joined IBM Corp in 1993 from consumer products distributor RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp and was with American Express Co prior to that.\n\"Maybe you don't actually have to have a guy who has time to get his hands dirty,\" Dzubeck said.\n\"I think the operating issues, the strategic issues become paramount,\" he said, while technology strategy can best be left to second and third-tier managers.\nOther outsiders who have become the top-guns at successful technology companies include Jim Barksdale of Netscape Communications Corp, the former chief information officer of air freight forwarder Federal Express Corp.\nAnother example would be Alex Mandl, the man Walter has initially been hired to replace as second-in-command at AT&T, following Mandl's departure in August to join a wireless communications venture of Associated Group Inc.\nBefore joining AT&T in 1991, Mandl headed SeaLand Services.\n\"He's transformed a large, old-line company challenged by new technologies and changing markets into a tough global competitor,\" said Allen in a statement. \"Meeting those challenges is what leading the 'new' AT&T is all about.\"",

        "Text": "Japan's Finance Ministry, which has long resisted calls from employers to reform the country's rigid corporate pension system, has finally decided to relax its tight grip.\nHowever, industry sources say its proposals fall short of what is needed to cope with Japan's rapidly \"greying\" society and the poor financial state of employee pension funds resulting from record-low interest rates and a weak economic recovery.\n\"Unless Japan undertakes a drastic overhaul of the corporate pension system, it will remain out of step with the rest of the world,\" said an official at an overseas-based investment advisory company.\nIn the past, the amount of money Japanese corporate pension funds held was so small that authorities could regulate them without too much difficulty. But the amount has grown to about 60 trillion yen ($540 billion) and unless the current system is changed, it will hurt corporate balance sheets, he said.\nYoshihiko Miyauchi, a key member of an advisory panel to the prime minister, said on Thursday that the Finance Ministry had stated in a subcommittee meeting on deregulation that it would abolish restrictions on where employee pension funds managed by trust banks could be invested.\nUnder the current rules, each trust bank must invest at least half of the funds it manages in fixed-income assets, no more than 30 percent in Japanese stocks, no more than 30 percent in foreign currency-denominated shares and bonds, and no more than 20 percent in real estate.\nJapan's corporate pension system is divided into employee pension funds, which are supervised by the Welfare Ministry, and Tax-Qualified Retirement Pension plans (TQPs), which are supervised by the Finance Ministry.\nMiyauchi said the Finance Ministry was still considering whether to allow investment advisory firms to manage TQPs. It also told the subcommittee that it was studying whether to allow variable yields and flexible benefits, he said.\nThe Welfare Ministry has steadily lifted its restrictions on the management on employee pension funds, which have assets estimated at 42 trillion yen ($378 billion), and allowed investment advisory firms to manage the funds.\nHowever, the Finance Ministry has barred investment advisory firms from managing TQPs, which have assets totalling 18 trillion yen ($162 billion). Only trust banks and life insurers are allowed to manage TQPs.\nEmployers participating in the corporate pension system are required to maintain specified yields, currently 5.5 percent a year, to guarantee predetermined benefits. But the actual return on investments is now only about three percent.\nBecause of the poor investment environment, many corporate pension funds are facing a shortage of funds to pay benefits to pensioners in the future, industry sources said. If pension funds fall short of meeting future payments, sponsoring companies must cover the shortfall.\nIndustry sources said that investment advisory firms, especially foreign companies, are keen to manage TQPs.\n\"Generally speaking, fund managers at Japanese companies are conservative,\" said the official with the investment advisory company.\n\"They tend to avoid investment risks because they see the risks, which are short-term volatility, as something dangerous. But experienced foreign advisors are well-qualified to manage pension funds as they take reasonable risks in long-term pension fund management over 20- to 30-year periods,\" he said.\nHe said British pension funds invest about 90 percent of their assets in equities, including about 15 percent in foreign stocks.\nKen Okamura, a strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson (Asia) Ltd, said in a recent report that if Japan completely abolished restrictions on asset management of corporate pension funds, it was likely to see more investment in local stocks.\nHe estimated that at the moment, life insurers and trust banks put an average of about 20 percent of the pension assets they are entrusted with into local stocks.",

        "Text": "Japan's depressed real estate market is unlikely to get much immediate help for its problems despite market euphoria over possible state purchases of land once owned by troubled financial firms, analysts said.\nTokyo's key stock index surged on Thursday, led by property-related issues, after a newspaper report saying the government was considering using public funds to buy collateralised land formerly owned by failed mortgage firms and other troubled financial firms.\nThe index, the Nikkei 225, ended up 2.43 percent at 19,051.71, its first close above 19,000 points for more than a month.\nA Finance Ministry official told Reuters a government panel was considering using funds already set aside in the next state budget to buy land formerly owned by troubled financial firms.\nVice Finance Minister Tadashi Ogawa later confirmed the possibility, telling a news conference it was possible public-sector firms may purchase such land.\nHe said the plan would help ease the liquidity crisis affecting real estate.\nA government panel, whose members include officials from the ministries of finance, construction and justice and the National Land Agency, was set up last October to tackle the tough issue of collecting problem loans for which land is being held as collateral.\nAt present, firms cannot afford to sell at market levels since they would realise their huge losses caused by the collapse of the \"bubble\" economy early this decade.\nThis has led to stagnation in the real estate market and kept the massive problem hanging over the whole financial sector.\n\"The panel has been discussing how to increase liquidity in the real estate market to facilitate collection of such problem loans,\" said an official at a bank involved in the discussions.\n\"But we have not talked about any details yet.\"\nHowever, he said that if the government decided to buy such collateralised land, it would have a positive impact since the private sector remained reluctant to buy land.\nJesper Koll, an economist at JP Morgan Securities Asia, said public land buying was not a new initiative and no new funds were likely to be allocated for the purchases.\nHowever, he said that more important than any public purchases was Hashimoto's promise to speed up the process of turning real estate into equity assets.\n\"The faster banks and real estate companies are allowed to securitise property assets, the greater their prospects for increased income generation,\" he said. \"Prime Minister Hashimoto is getting serious about fixing Japan's real estate problem sooner, not later.\"\nYoshinobu Yamada, a financial analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc, said that while the move by the government panel on land was not a new initiative, it would have a positive impact in the long-term.\n\"The government is well aware that it must take steps to stop falling land prices,\" he said, adding that a lack of land liquidity was at the core of Japan's bad-loan mess.\n\"If the government buys collateralised land formerly owned by jusen, this is likely to give psychological support to the the real estate markets and help the markets bottom out.\"\nHowever, he said no concrete policy steps would be available until March so that the current euphoria on the Tokyo's stock market could be only a passing fancy.",

The financial system was jolted as major regional bank Hyogo Bank and the country's biggest credit union, Kizu Shinyo Kumiai, collapsed due to adventurous lending during the \"bubble economy\" of the late 1980s.\nAhead of that dark day, the biggest credit union in Tokyo, Cosmo Shinyo Kumiai, had collapsed, and then this year, second-tier regional bank Taiheiyo Bank went under.\nSeveral analysts expect more bank failures.\n\"Everyone knows what has to happen (more financial failures), but no one knows when and how and who pays,\" an analyst at a foreign securities firm said.\nTo dispose of 10.7 trillion yen ($99.0 billion) of loan losses, many of Japan's biggest banks posted net losses in the fiscal 1995/96, ended March 31.\nBut counting all deposit-taking institutions, on that date there were still 8.3 trillion yen ($76.8 billion) of loan losses which need to be written off, the Finance Ministry said.\nIn June, parliament passed bills to clean up the nation's bad loan mess and deal with bank failures, along with a scheme to wind up failed mortgage firms, using taxpayers' money.\nAnalysts are cool about such efforts, however.\nA spokeswoman at international credit-rating agency Moody's Investors Service said it has not much changed its BFSR (bank financial strength rating) since August last year, when it unveiled the BFSR for major Japanese banks for the first time.\nMoody's last week warned that some of Japan's seven major trust banks may need external support in order to survive growing competition and the burden of bad debts.\nMoody's gave Chuo Trust & Banking and Yasuda Trust & Banking an \"E\" ranking, meaning that they suffer from very weak intrinsic financial strength, and gave only a slightly better \"E+\" rating to Mitsui Trust & Banking and Nippon Trust Bank.\nIt also kept Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Nippon Credit Bank at the \"E\" it gave them last August.\n\"We expect banks with very weak financial fundamentals to ultimately require assistance either from the authorities or from their respective corporate group members,\" Moody's said.",

The firm had resisted the break-up plans until the holding company option was offered.\nU.S. occupation forces introduced the ban on holding companies in 1947 to break up powerful conglomerates, known as \"zaibatsu\", which the United States said had contributed to Japan's war effort.\n\"I am sure the ban will be relaxed broadly in line with ideas the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has been advocating,\" said Hideo Fujiwara, senior research fellow at LTCB Research Institute Inc.\nThe Fair Trade Commission (FTC), the anti-monopoly watchdog, said last week it plans to submit a bill to end the ban to the session of parliament which starts in January.\nLast January, the FTC sought to revise the Anti-Monopoly Law to broadly remove the ban, which had the backing of the pro-business LDP.\nBut that failed when the Social Democratic Party, a member in the then-ruling coalition, called for only a partial lifting of the ban.\nIf the bill passes next year, the ban would be relaxed by October 1997 at the earliest.\n\"Even if the ban is lifted, not many companies will make use of the new corporate structure immediately,\" Fujiwara said.\nCompanies such as Sony Corp, Canon Inc and Asahi Glass Co Ltd may be able to establish holding companies as they have already split their operations, he said, but many other companies have not.\nBut financial companies are in a better position to take advantage of the change, some economists said.\n\"Holding companies will enable banks, brokers and insurers to break down barriers between them,\" said Yushiro Ikuyo, a first vice president at Smith Barney International Inc.\nIkuyo said a holding company would make it easy for a big financial institution to streamline its corporate group, in particular, bailing out an ailing financial firm in the group.\nThe economists also said regional banks which tie up under a holding company would be able to boost their coverage areas.\nSome warn, however, that financial holding companies would not solve all the problems facing the financial industry, in which too many deposit-taking institutions are competing.\n\"Like the recently collapsed Hanwa Bank, not all failed financial institutions can be bailed out through a holding company,\" LTCB Research's Fujiwara said.\nThe Finance Ministry last month suspended most operations at Hanwa and will eventually wind down the regional bank, which collapsed under the weight of its problem loans.",

This compared with disposals of 2.69 trillion yen ($24.0 billion) last year.\nA trust bank executive said the banks' combined parent current profit for the first half was a record as Japanese authorities had eased special reserve requirements for trust banks in March to free up funds to dispose of problem loans.\nAnalysts said the seven banks would use about one trillion yen ($8.9 billion) of the special reserves to write off problem loans in fiscal 1996/97.\nAtsushi Takahashi, the managing director of Sumitomo Trust, told reporters that the bank aims to reduce its problem loans to manageable levels in the current financial year.",

If it doesn't, we will lose out to our Western rivals,\" he said.\nThe most important and urgent issue for Nikko is how to cut personnel costs while raising the salaries of talented young workers and maintaining overall morale, he said.\nHe acknowledged this would be a very difficult task and he had no specific ideas at this time, but Japan's manufacturers had already made impressive progress in this area.\n\"(Japanese) manufacturers say that brokerages and financial institutions have been living the good life. That's why they say it will be difficult for us to restructure,\" he said.\nTinkering with personnel practices is widely considered taboo at large Japanese companies.\nPrime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto unveiled plans in November for a five-year \"Big Bang\" set of policy moves to liberalise Japan's financial markets and catch up with reforms carried out more than a decade ago in Europe and North America.\nMarket sources said that since late last year the Tokyo stock market has focused on the negative impact of the Big Bang reform on Japanese financial institutions, as they would heat up the competition and create losers as well as winners in the financial markets.\nOn Friday, the key Nikkei average of 225 leading shares ended down 220.10 points, or 1.23 percent, at 17,689.36. The index has shed nearly 2,000 points since the beginning of this year, led by the banking and brokerage sector.\nYuki said that, while Tokyo's Big Bang would eventually provide business opportunities for brokers and help revitalize Japan's financial markets, it would also pressure brokers' earnings in the near term.\n\"It is inevitable that we'll face a tough fight for profits in the near term,\" he said. \"Such a severe business environment may result in an industry-wide shakeout including mergers and acquisitions.\"\nLast week, Moody's Investors Service issued a grim rating outlook for Japanese brokerages, noting that the securities industry was faced with the dual challenges of operating in volatile markets and strategically repositioning itself in a deregulated landscape.\nThe likely elimination of fixed commission rates on stockbroking was cited as one move likely to undermine profitability at many brokerages, it said.\nYuki said that there would be no quick remedies to boost currently sagging bank and brokerage stocks, but policies were need to ensure Japan's economic recovery and implement drastic reforms of the nation's economic structure.\nHe added that the abolition of Japan's securities transaction tax, as urged by some politicians and business leaders, would also help Japan's stock market.\nJapan is the only country with a securities transaction tax.\n\"I don't advocate any government moves to artificially prop up stock prices ... but announcing the abolition (of the tax by the end of March) would have a good effect on stocks,\" he said.\nHe said that, since Japan has already announced a sweeping deregulation of foreign exchange transactions beginning in 1998, failure to abolish the transaction tax would encourage institutional investors to go abroad to trade Japanese stocks due to higher costs here.",

The claims were transferred from the failed jusen firms to the body.\nIn total, Sueno Kosan group's liabilities are estimated at 620 billion yen ($5.48 billion), said Tokyo Commerce and Industry Research Co, a private credit research body.\nJapan's banking industry was also jolted last month when a major financing company, Nichiei Finance Co Ltd, filed for liquidation with huge debt liabilities. Like the jusen and Sueno Kosan, Nichiei was a casualty of the property-related lending boom in the late 1980s \"bubble era\" and the subsequent dive in asset prices.\nThe Osaka court has taken steps to seize the assets of Sueno Kosan and its affiliates in response to the application, the HLAC statement said. There was no immediate comment from Sueno Kosan on the moves.\nAlthough the overall damage to the financial system may be slight, analysts said individual non-bank financial institutions with outstanding loans to Sueno could suffer. A non-bank financial institution makes loans but does not take deposits, raising funds by borrowing from banks.\n\"Should Sueno be forced into bankruptcy and its assets distributed, many of the other lender non-banks will be forced to absorb huge losses relative to their size,\" said James Fiorillo, ING Baring Securities (Japan) analyst.\n\"This will probably force many of them (creditors) into distress or bankruptcy, so the outcome...should be closely watched,\" he said.\nFinance Minister Wataru Kubo did not appear to be that worried, although he told reporters the Sueno Kosan problem might spread to financial firms that had lent it money.\n\"However, such an impact will be resolved among related financial institutions in accordance with our financial system,\" he said.\nNoboru Matsuda, governor of the Deposit Insurance Corp of Japan (DIC), which supervises the HLAC, said in a statement that it was inevitable such action would be taken against some \"malignant\" borrowers like Sueno, which he said had repeatedly attempted to hide assets.\nIn June, Japan adopted a controversial plan that allowed for the use of 685 billion yen ($6.06 billion) in public funds to help wind up the jusen.",

Since the cancellation of pension fund management contracts, the gap has been narrowing.\nThe payouts are calculated based on prospective investment yields at the time insurance policies were written.\nMeiji Life's Mochida said the overall average guaranteed rate of return offered by life insurers would fall to about four percent in 1996/97 from about five percent in 1995/96, while investment yields would remain low at around three percent.\nThe eight firms also announced a combined 2.15 trillion yen ($19.0 billion) of problem loans as of the end of September, the first time they had revealed such statistics.\nThey said that at the end of September the amount of this total classified as \"bad loans\" -- loans to bankrupt companies and those on which interest payments are in arrears of six months or more -- was 1.06 trillion yen ($9.3 billion).",

But these have been slow in getting results, and criticism from the United States and other major trading partners has continued.\nPrime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's government has wanted to step up efforts to cut bureaucratic red tape to boost the fragile economy, because its high-cost structure is making the country less attractive to investors.\nThe panel, set up in July by the Economic Planning Agency, comprises six subcommittees focusing on finance, information technology, distribution, land, employment and medicine.\nThe subcommittees on land, distribution and medicine presented proposals last week and the two on employment and medicine unveiled recommendations separately on Thursday, all of which called for sweeping reform in each field.\nThe proposals will become an outline for the advisory council's final recommendation to the prime minister, which will be made in December after the council hears the opinions of bureaucrats on each issue.\nPanel chairman Koichi Minaguchi told a news conference that he wanted to ensure that the panel's efforts would not be a \"total waste of energy\".\n\"The ministries concerned all agree that they are heading in the direction outlined in the reports, but when it comes to specifics, they said they still have different opinions,\" Minaguchi said.\nEPA officials were also cautious about the future of the proposals by the panel, however, as any action taken may hinge on the outcome of general elections set for October 20.\n\"It is not clear how ministers in the new government to be formed will treat those proposals,\" an EPA official said.\nHaruo Shimada, also a key member of the panel, said, however, that any delay in overhauling laws relating to employment would be \"suicidal\".",

Despite the buoyant business overseas, the brokerage tipped into the red on a parent and a group net basis after deciding to put large sums of money into helping an ailing financial affiliate.\nIn the business year that ended on March 31, 1996, pre-tax profits at Nomura's consolidated subsidiaries overseas totalled 47.1 billion yen ($420 million).\nIn the April-September period, European subsidiaries led by London-based Nomura International Plc posted current profits of 9.8 billion yen ($87.5 million), more than five times the amount a year earlier, the official said.\nHitoshi Tonomura, a new chairman who arrived at Nomura International in London in the spring of last year, helped to bring operations there back into profit, he said.\nCurrent profits at Asian units were 1.5 billion yen ($13.3 million), slightly up from a year earlier, while those at subsidiaries in the American region totalled 6.4 billion yen ($57.1 million), little changed from a year earlier, he said.\nThe official said successful asset securitisation business by Nomura International fuelled the sharp increase in the profits there, and profits in the United States came largely from the asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities business.\nAs for business in Asia, he said: \"We are still in the stage of investment and not getting returns yet, although we are allocating our human and other resources there.\"\nNomura used to announce its group results about a month after the parent earnings but has brought the group statement forward to provide more timely information for investors.\nIn the first half, it posted parent current profit of 69.87 billion yen ($623 million), while group current profit stood at 74.76 billion yen. However, it posted a hefty half-year net loss on both a parent and consolidated basis after providing financial support of 37.1 billion yen ($331 million) for an ailing non-bank financial affiliate in the Nomura group.\nThe parent net loss was 337.54 billion yen ($3.01 billion) and the group net loss 332.01 billion yen ($2.96 billion).\nCurrent profit is pre-tax, and includes losses and gains on non-operating activities.

Unlisted derivatives include swap trading such as interest-rate swaps.\nThe new rules do not affect corporate balance sheets, but disclosing the data is a step towards introducing mark-to-market accounting for financial products holdings.\nJapan is working toward using international standards, said Hirokazu Moriyama, general manager at Yamaichi Research Institute of Securities & Economics.\n\"I expect Japan to introduce international accounting standards by the end of the fiscal 1998/1999, as the European Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States have stated their support for the IASC process in setting international accounting standards,\" Moriyama said.\nIASC, the International Accounting Standards Committee, has been working out principles of international accounting rules that can be applied in consistent ways in different countries.\nIt is expected to complete the process by March 1998.\nThe International Organisation of Securities Commissions, comprised of governmental securities authorities, including Japan, decided in July last year that it would take steps towards accepting IASC accountancy proposals.\nSonoda said, however, it was still unclear how far Japan would go in adopting mark-to-market methods in securities holdings and derivatives trading.\nThe United States basically uses the mark-to-market appraisal for securities holdings.\nSonoda says if international accounting standards follow the U.S. method, the impact would be enormous on Japanese corporations.\n\"Japanese companies own huge amounts of stocks in unique cross holdings, and they have massive unrealised profits on those holdings as they bought the shares a long time ago at cheap prices.\"\nIf those hidden profits are appraised in balance sheets, the boost in assets would deteriorate the return on equity (ROE) at Japanese companies.\nROE is a common financial yardstick, showing how efficiently a company is using its capital.\n\"This may reveal how poorly Japanese companies make use of shareholders' capital...\" Sonoda said.\nCurrently, the ROE for Japanese companies is about 3.8 percent, compared with more than 10 percent for U.S. companies.",

It looks like the banks all think they can do everything with unlimited resources,\" he said.\nSince the early 1990s, Japanese banks have written off problem loans resulting from their adventurous lending policies in the late 1980 \"bubble economy\" of inflated asset prices.\nBut as of the end of September, 20 major banks were still carrying 23 trillion yen ($201 billion) worth of problem loans.\nAnalysts say it will take two more years on average for the top 20 banks to cut the loans to manageable levels, giving foreign banks further chances to to nudge into the market.\n\"Foreign banks have expanded and strengthened their business base in the past decade, but Japanese banks were not able to do anything because they had to dispose of the problem loans,\" said IBCA's Ozeki.\nJapan's 20 biggest banks, down from 21 after a merger in April between Bank of Tokyo and Mitsubishi Bank, posted 22.85 trillion yen ($200 billion) in parent operating profits in an eight-year period to the end of March this year.\nDuring that time they also disposed of 21.7 trillion yen ($190 billion) in problem loans, Ozeki said.\nEven profitability at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which many analysts agree is the strongest Japanese candidate to become an internationally competitive bank, is low.\nThe bank's return on equity, a gauge to show the efficiency of the use of capital, is only about 7.2 percent, compared with Barclays Plc's 13.09 percent and Bankers Trust's 18.32 percent, an IBCA study showed.\nAnalysts say they expect more bank failures in Japan, particularly among smaller regional banks and credit unions.\nIn November, Japanese authorities ordered the regional Hanwa Bank to halt business, the third regional bank failure since the end of World War Two. Eleven smaller credit unions and associations have also gone under since December 1994.\nAnalysts said uncertainty over how to deal with troubled banks has not been entirely removed in Japan, and there remains some concern that larger and stronger banks may be drawn into the support mechanism at some cost to themselves.\nJapanese banks to which Moody's has given a bank financial strength rating (BFSR) of \"E\" are financially weak, Okabe said.\nChuo Trust & Banking and Yasuda Trust & Banking, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Nippon Credit Bank are the E rated banks.",

        "Text": "One year after its dramatic expulsion from the United States, scandal-hit Daiwa Bank is finding its misfortune may in some ways have been a blessing in disguise, analysts say.\nThe painful fall-out from its $1.1 billion bond-trading loss in the United States, they say, forced the bank to take some of the bitter but necessary restructuring measures that other Japanese banks have been reluctant to swallow.\n\"Following its expulsion from the United States and inspections by Japan\"s Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan, Daiwa was able to eliminate management risks from its corporate structure,\" said Yukiko Ohara, a financial analyst at UBS Securities Ltd.\n\"It (Daiwa) could be a model for restructuring at other banks, which still lack a sense of crisis despite the recent fall in their share prices,\" she said.\nBy the end of March, 2000, Daiwa\"s restructuring efforts are likely to help boost its annual operating profits above 100 billion yen ($800 million), despite the negative impact of asset reductions overseas, Ohara said. In the year to March 1997 Daiwa forecast operating profits of 80 billion yen ($640 million).\nA Daiwa official agreed that the harm done by the bond-loss scandal was not as great as initially expected.\n\"We feared that we might suffer substantial damage from the withdrawal from U.S. markets,\" Daiwa bank director Akiyoshi Otani told Reuters in a recent interview. \"But the damage was not great.... Our customers stayed calm and have been supporting us.\"\n\"The strategies we have taken (since the withdrawal from the United States) have not been wrong,\" he added.\nIn November 1995, two months after news broke that a Daiwa trader in New York lost $1.1 billion on unauthorised deals, U.S. bank regulatory authorities ordered Daiwa to shut down its U.S. operations. Daiwa pleaded guilty to charges including conspiracy and fraud and paid a record $340 million in fines.\nJapan\"s Finance Ministry also placed temporary restrictions on Daiwa\"s operations and ordered the institution, Japan\"s ninth largest commercial bank, to work out a drastic streamlining programme.\nLast April, Daiwa announced a two-year plan to focus on its three strengths: the Kansai area around Osaka in western Japan, where it has a strong customer base, the Asian market, and the trust business, which includes pension fund management. Daiwa manages more pension fund money than any other Japanese bank.\nIt also decided to shut about 36 offices, including 16 overseas, by March 1999, and by the end of last September had cut its assets to 16.30 trillion yen ($130 billion) from 19.36 trillion yen ($154 billion) a year earlier. Daiwa also plans to reduce the number of its employees by about 2,000 by March 2000, from 9,151 last September.\nBut some analysts insisted the bank\"s restructuring had not gone far enough, noting it was still saddled with 790 billion yen ($6.32 billion) in problem loans, or 7.4 percent of loans outstanding, as of last September.\nYushiro Ikuyo, first vice president at Smith Barney International Inc\"s Tokyo branch, added that the expulsion from the United States was bound to damage Daiwa\"s future business.\n\"I doubt whether Daiwa can continue to manage its international business without U.S. operations,\" he said. \"The business environment surrounding Japanese banks will become much tougher and Daiwa must make extra efforts to streamline its business, even halving its assets.\"\nSeveral analysts have suggested that Daiwa\"s woes may force it to combine with another financial institution. Last month, Moody\"s Investors Service said Daiwa Bank and Nomura Securities, its largest shareholder, may join under the same holding company.\nBut Daiwa\"s Otani dismissed such talk for now.\n\"We should not forget that we are still in the process of recovering our creditworthiness.... Although there is talk about mergers or a holding company, this is not an issue for us at the moment,\" he said. ($=125 yen)",

Japan's interest rates fell to record low levels in the last fiscal year and have remained there.\nOf the 10 banks,  Hokkaido Takushoku, Sakura, Fuji, Daiwa, Sanwa, Tokai and Asahi posted current losses in 1995/96.\nThe 10 banks -- including the Bank of Tokyo and Mitsubishi Bank which merged into the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi on April 1, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, and Sumitomo Bank -- disposed of 6.31 trillion yen ($56.8 billion) worth of problem loans in 1995/96.\nBankers said that they would continue to dispose of problem loans in the latter half of 1996/97 after doing so in the first half by setting aside loan-loss provisions and selling them to a joint problem loan liquidation body.",

        "Text": "Japan's financial industry is gradually recovering from the bad-debt hangover left by the economic \"bubble\" years, but the pain lingers on for smaller banks and loan institutions.\nAnalysts say the industry has got over the worst of the bad loan mess after vigorous efforts by the government and major banks over the past year to tackle the problem. Any further serious damage to the system is therefore unlikely, they say.\nBut the picture is darker for small institutions that lack the financial might of the big banks but were similarly saddled with soured loans from the late 1980s lending boom.\nAnalysts say it will take years to restore confidence in the banking sector given the lingering problems and exposure to the troubled real estate and construction industries.\nThe nervousness was highlighted last month by the collapse of financing firm Nichiei Finance Co Ltd with huge debt liabilities, and revelations of losses at a regional bank because of suspected misuse of funds by an ex-employee.\nBoth these incidents jolted financial markets. In the case of Biwako Bank, the markets were unsettled by vague rumours of dire trouble before the bank said it had lost money due to the suspected misappropration but remained in sound health.\nA new restructuring programme unveiled two weeks ago by Tobishima Corp, a contractor and engineering company, also fuelled concerns that banks would face new burdens as ailing firms seek further support while trying to reshape themselves.\nKatsuhito Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Center, said the banks are dealing with the problem in stages -- first with their own bad loans, then the problems of affiliated firms and, finally, the issue of other debtors.\n\"Banks are trying to dispose of problem loans to independent non-banks after mostly completing write-offs of debt held by their non-bank affiliates,\" he said.\nFailures of troubled non-banks are already anticipated and it may take one or two years for the big banks to fully recover from the mess, he said.\nNon-banks are financial firms which do not take deposits but rely mostly on loans from banks and other deposit-taking bodies such as agricultural credit cooperatives.\nLike the \"jusen\" mortgage firms, which were wound up this year, many non-banks are in trouble. They lent to golf-course and resort companies that joined hands with developers looking for easy profits during the free-wheeling \"bubble\" years.\nWhen asset prices began to plunge in the early 1990s, many firms which had relied on borrowed funds for investments were unable to repay the money, causing a ripple effect of bad debt.\nThe Finance Ministry said this week that outstanding loans by Japan's 249 non-banks fell 4.4 percent to 50.74 trillion yen ($449 billion) at the end of March from a year earlier.\nAnalysts said Nichiei's main creditors -- Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB), Asahi Bank and the Bank of Yokohama -- are expected to give up their claims after the company filed for restructuring under court guidance, a category of business failure under Japan's bankruptcy laws.\nAs of March, DKB had 56 billion yen ($495 million) ($495 million) in loans to Nichiei Finance, while Asahi had 32 billion yen ($283 million) and Bank of Yokohama 20 billion yen ($176 million) in loans, they said.\nJames Fiorillo, a ING Baring Securities (Japan) analyst, said the amount these three write off for Nichiei will only be about a fifth of their total disposals this fiscal year.\nDKB has predicted an operating profit for 1996/97 to next March of about 320 billion yen ($2.83 billion) and current profit, a form of pre-tax profit including non-operating activities, of 40 billion yen ($353 million). This suggests DKB may use the difference -- 280 billion yen ($2.47 billion) -- to write off problem loans.\nJapan's 20 big banks are already planning to dispose of 3.5 trillion yen ($30.9 billion) to 4.0 trillion yen ($35.3 billion) of problem loans in 1996/97 after writing off nearly 11 trillion yen ($97.3 billion) in 1995/96, analysts estimated.\nIt will, however, take some time for creditor banks to solve the problem of the non-banks including Nichiboshin Ltd and Apollo Leasing Co Ltd.\nThe search for a solution is complicated by the fact that the non-banks are part of a web of lending, having borrowed from more than 100 creditors including financially weak agricultural credit unions.",

These unrealised profits are a source of funds to cover sudden losses and write-offs of problem loans and make up for negative spreads between low investment yields and already promised payouts.\nThe payouts are calculated based on prospective investment yields at the time insurance policies were written.\nIf the Nikkei average of 225 leading shares is around 19,000 on March 31, when the companies close their books for 1996/97, unrealised profits on shareholdings at three life insurers -- Toho Mutual Life, Nissan Mutual Life and Kyoei Life -- will be wiped out, the sources said.\nA Nikkei fall to 18,000 would make the unrealised profits at Tokyo Mutual Life, Nippon Dantai Life and Daihyaku Mutual Life disappear, while the crucial level is 17,000 for Sumitomo Life and Chiyoda Mutual Life, they said.\nOn Thursday, the Nikkei closed down 471.26 points at 17,864.04. But on Friday morning the index bounced back, rising 570.68 points by midday.\nChiyoda, Nissan, Kyoei, Tokyo, Nippon Dantai, and Daihyaku all posted before-tax current losses in the year to March 31, 1995. Toho also did so, for the second straight year.",

But the government says further losses may arise and that half of any future losses will be covered by public money.\nIn June, the government adopted a controversial scheme that allows for the use of 685 billion yen ($6.17 billion) in taxpayers' money to help wind up the failed mortgage firms.\nThe government has also committed itself to meeting any potential shortfalls at the Resolution and Collection Bank with government funds.\nThe bank was established last month to manage the holdings of failed credit unions and collect their problem loans. The government has given the bank a 10-year period to bail out credit unions and aims to disband the bank thereafter.\nSome analysts said, however, that it would be tough for the ministries to agree on steps to boost the sagging real estate market, now in a five-year-long slump following the bursting of the 1980s \"bubble economy\" of inflated asset prices.\nFor instance, Japan may have to allocate budget funds for public utilisation of assets put up as collateral for problem loans, analysts said. The government should also adopt a flexible taxation system to help securitise problem loans backed by real estate, they said.\nSecuritising the loans involves selling property to a new special-purpose company, which in turn will issue bonds backed by these assets to procure money. Investors in the bonds would profits from any rise in land prices and from rent income.\nThe number of investors in Japan is still limited due to fears of further drops in land prices, and financial institutions themselves are reluctant to sell collateralised land at the currently cheap market prices, analysts said.\nBut Yukiko Ohara, an analyst at UBS Securities, said the setting up of a panel to discuss this dilemma is an important first step. \"It is better than nothing.\"",

        "Text": "The collapse of a major real estate company which borrowed heavily from Japan's \"jusen\" mortgage firms would be unlikely to have any major negative impact on the financial industry, analysts said on Tuesday.\nEarlier on Tuesday, a semi-governmental body set up to collect problem loans run up by the \"jusen\" companies said it was seeking the involuntary bankruptcy of unlisted real estate firm Sueno Kosan.\nThe Housing Loan Administration Corp (HLAC) made the request to an Osaka court.  \n\"The action has been already factored in (to the financial markets),\" said Takakazu Nakamori, an official at credit research firm Teikoku Databank.\nHe said the Finance Ministry appeared to have recognised the problem and given the go-ahead for the forced bankruptcy.\nYushiro Ikuyo, first vice president at Smith Barney International, said the loan body was taking the right course of action, given the severity of the Sueno Kosan problem.  \nBanks which had loans to the failed jusen firms and related companies like Sueno Kosan have mostly made loan loss provisions, as well as forgiving loans under the government's scheme to wind up the firms, he said. Those creditors will not have any problem from the expected insolvency, he said.\nThe HLAC said in a statement that it had also asked the Osaka District Court to start bankruptcy proceedings for two of Sueno Kosan's affiliates. The court has taken steps to seize their assets in response to the application, it also said.\nThe application also sought bankruptcy proceedings against three individuals associated with the firm, including president Kenichi Sueno, the HLAC said in its statement.  \nThe HLAC said it has claims totalling 347 billion yen on Sueno Kosan and two of its group firms. The claims were transferred from the failed jusen firms to the body, it said.\nIn June, Japan adopted a framework that allowed for the use of 685 billion yen of public money to help wind up the jusen.\nThe HLAC inherited assets totalling 6.5 trillion yen from the seven failed firms after 6.4 trillion yen worth of unrecoverable loans were written off with the help of financial institutions and public money.\nKatsuhito Sasajima, a Nikko Research Centre analyst, said the action by the body was good news.  \n\"The insolvency of Sueno is not a matter of damage to the financial system... Rather, the market would probably appreciate the action as such legal procedures are transparent,\" Nikko's Sasajima said.\nAn HLAC official quoted a senior official of the Deposit Insurance Corp of Japan (DIC) as telling reporters in Osaka that the decision to seek the insolvency was taken after consultation with the Finance Ministry and that the move would not greatly affect the financial system as a whole.  \nBut although the overall damage to the financial system may be slight, analysts said individual non-bank financial institutions with outstanding loans to Sueno could suffer.\n\"Should Sueno be forced into bankrutpcy and its assets distributed, many of the other lender non-banks will be forced to absorb huge losses relative to their size,\" ING Baring Securities (Japan) analyst James Fiorillo said.\nIf Sueno Kosan is declared bankrupt, it would be one of the biggest Japanese insolvencies on record, analysts said.\n\"This will probably force many of them (creditors) into distress or bankruptcy, so the outcome...should be closely watched,\" Fiorillo said. In total, the Sueno Kosan group has liabilities of about 600 billion yen, he added.\nSeveral analysts said that a non-bank institution, Apollo Leasing Co Ltd, may be affected. An official at Apollo said that the company has loans to Sueno Kosan and will try to figure out the impact of its collapse. He did not give further details. Non-bank financial institutions make loans but do not take deposits, borrowing money instead from banks.\nThere was no immediate comment from Sueno Kosan itself about the move by the loan-collecting body.  \nA survey by the Tokyo Commerce and Industry Research Co, a private sector research arm, said Apollo Leasing had 21.13 billion yen in loans to Sueno as of the end of December 1995.\nOther major creditors to Sueno at the end of last December included Inter-Lease Corp with claims of 5.35 billion yen, All Corp with 6.0 billion yen and Crown Leasing Corp with 17.6 billion yen, the research body said.\nAnalysts said the non-bank financial institutions had undertaken restructuring programmes by asking creditors to do such things as cut interest payments on loans and delay principal payments.",

In the past, the unrealised profits on these holdings have helped burnish the banks' balance sheets and have provided a useful way of getting some of their problem loans off their books.\nBut the failure to tackle the problem more aggressively has in turn fueled scepticism about the soundness of the Japanese banking system, triggering more selloffs in the stock market, analysts said.\nThe analysts said banks should try to raise their profitability by focusing on specialised business fields, by developing new financial instruments and by lending to smaller firms with prospects for future growth.\nKatsuhito Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Centre, said: \"To convince investors, banks must take the extra step to restructure, but they have made no such effort so far.\"\nIn the three business years to the end of March 1996, Japan's then top 21 banks used 8.01 trillion yen ($68.4 billion) in net capital gains from the sale of equities to help dispose of 18.96 trillion yen ($162 billion) of property-related problem loans, a legacy from the late 1980s economic \"bubble\" era of inflated asset prices.\nBut the top banks still had 17.4 trillion yen ($148 billion) of problem loans at the end of last September, the Finance Ministry said.\nMoody's Investors Service said on Friday that the sharp fall in Japanese shares will affect financially weak banks.",

        "Text": "Trading on most of China's futures markets, under pressure from Beijing to curb speculation, has now dropped so far that hedging has become virtually impossible, traders and analysts said on Tuesday.\nA trader with a futures firm in Shanghai said only the metals contracts market, the Shanghai Metal Exchange, still had enough liquidity and flexibility to allow companies to hedge risk.\nBeijing has recently issued two key documents encouraging the securities markets but warning the futures markets of more clean-ups and restructuring to come.\nRumours have swirled around the futures markets in recent days that Beijing plans to merge or close many of the 15 futures exchanges in the country, possibly concentrating all futures trading into five exchanges.\n\"From what I hear about the feedback from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), there is no such plan,\" said Xie Boxing, deputy manager of the Information Department of the Shanghai Cereals and Oils Exchange (SCOE).\n\"There is no change to the basic policy of developing these markets,\" he added.\nBut Xie said liquidity on the exchange, particularly in rice, had fallen off as a result of the Beijing statements on the futures markets, making it difficult for companies to use the exchange for hedging.\n\"The scale of trading at this point is a bit small for hedging,\" he said.\nThe irony of the crackdown on the futures markets is that it has removed the basis for hedging and left only speculators in the market, one analyst said.\nA second Chinese futures company trader said the trading volume of most commodity futures contracts on Chinese exchanges was now so small that there was no opportunity for hedging operations to take place.\n\"The only people trading the contracts for most of these commodities are speculators,\" the trader said.\nA spokesman for the CSRC in Beijing on Monday told Reuters that the authorities still wanted the futures markets to develop despite the recent documents on the futures markets stressing current problems.\n\"This does not mean that futures market should cease to develop, development is a constant theme for China's futures market,\" he said.\nBut the spokesman declined to comment on the rumours of impending closures and mergers of futures exchanges.\n\"I cannot say anything on measures to deal with the markets in the future, I don't know whether some futures exchanges would be closed,\" he added.\nOne trader said that while the authorities would probably not formally close any of the exchanges, they could take other measures to in effect slowly strangle them such as raising the margin requirements on various contracts.\nSCOE's Xie said the authorities still viewed the futures exchanges, set up in the early 1990s, as an experiment, but he felt that in the end they would prove their value.\n\"There should be a bright future for futures, particularly for contracts for agricultural products. That's how the futures business began in other parts of the world, and China is a big agricultural producer,\" he said.\nBut for now, trading volumes are down significantly on the SCOE compared to last year.\nUp to Monday, 6.40 million lots on all contracts changed hands on the exchange this year compared to a full-year total of 13.5 million lots last year, he said. One lot is five tonnes of commodities.",

        "Text": "Chinese authorities have closed their eyes to the booming illegal trade by domestic investors in foreign currency B shares and will not interfere unless the market becomes too speculative, analysts said on Friday.\nThe B shares listed on China's two stock markets, in Shanghai and Shenzhen, were created to attract funds from foreign investors.\nBut in the past six months the vast majority of trading has been done by domestic investors who have opened trading accounts by various means in contravention of the rules.\n\"The authorities have just closed their eyes to the issue,\" said an analyst with a foreign securities firm in Shanghai. \"It looks like they will just leave it alone, as long as the markets don't become too speculative.\"\nGiven the huge volatility of the B shares over the past two weeks, it would appear the threshold of the authorities on the issue is high.\nShenzhen's B shares have risen more than 50 percent since mid-November and Shanghai's B shares are up over 15 percent in the same period, but with huge falls on some days.\nBrokers have attributed the rapid rises and falls largely to rumours that the Beijing authorities plan either to allow domestic investors to buy B shares or to reaffirm the ban.\n\"The Beijing ban is there, but Beijing knows it is unenforceable,\" said another brokerage analyst. \"And the brokers want local people to buy B shares because turnover would be so low without them.\"\nA broker in Shenzhen said many domestic securities firms had opened B share trading accounts in Hong Kong, while Chinese individuals encounter no problem in opening the accounts, particularly in Shenzhen, which is just across the border from the wealthy British colony.\nB-share trading is supposed to be restricted to people with foreign passports or residents of Hong Kong and Taiwan, but the Shenzhen and Shanghai exchanges are interpreting the rules with great flexibility, analysts said.\n\"The Shanghai exchange handled it in an interesting way,\" said a broker in Shanghai.\n\"A couple of months ago they required all B-share trading account holders to re-register, but all that they required was that people present a passport or a copy of a passport that didn't even have to be theirs,\" he said.\nAnalysts have said the basic reason for the ban on domestic investors holding B shares is to prevent an outflow of foreign exchange as foreign investors sell their holdings to local people.\nBut the announcement on Thursday that the Chinese yuan would become fully convertible on the current account this Sunday was taken as a sign by traders that the day was approaching when the ban on B share trading by locals would be dropped.\nThe Shenzhen B-share index rose 5.35 percent to 142.71 points on Friday on the news, brokers said. Shanghai B shares closed up 1.14 percent to 53.421.\n\"It is pretty hard for the securities regulators to curb the inflow of money from mainland Chinese into the Shenzhen B market because Hong Kong dollars are so easily available here due to the proximity to Hong Kong,\" said one Shenzhen analyst.\n\"I believe more and more Chinese will put their hard currency into the market after mid-1997 when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule,\" he added.",

It will be held very soon,\" Zhou, general manager of the Bund Buildings Transformation Corp, said in an interview. \"The basic issues have now been basically agreed upon.\"\nHe declined to say which companies were in the final running but said he expected the winner to be a bank.\n\"It is not the Hongkong & Shanghai Bank,\" he added.\nThe Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd, a unit of HSBC Holdings Plc, had more than two years of discussions with Shanghai city officials on terms for resuming control of their former headquarters but finally announced that they had decided not to proceed with the proposal.\nZhou said the Hongkong Bank had wanted to demolish several buildings behind the main structure and erect a modern office tower.\nBut he said this proposal would have had an impact on wider development plans for the area which have not yet been fixed and are unlikely to be finalised for at least another year or two.\nThe main building has 24,000 square metres of space and Zhou said he was looking at around three U.S. dollars per square metre per day in rental. The lease can be for any period up to 30 or 40 years.\n\"The rental fee we are looking for is based on the fact the Bund should be the highest priced piece of land (in Shanghai). If other buildings are currently renting for two dollars a day (per square metre), then this building should be three dollars,\" he said.\nAt that price, the monthly rental fee for the building would be over $2 million per month. Renovation costs, he estimated, would cost around $15 million.\nThe building is steeped in history. After serving in effect as the East Asian financial headquarters of western imperialism for a quarter of century, it became after 1949 the Communist Party's Shanghai headquarters and city hall.\nThe city officials finally moved into a new building last year, leaving the old bank empty and echoing, waiting for a new tenant.\nThe main banking hall, with its magnificent marble pillars and curved glass roof, has had its banking counters removed and the murals which adorned the main domed entrance hall have been painted over.\nThe room just off the hall which served as the bank's general manager's office and later the office of a succession of Shanghai city Communist Party chiefs, is small and airless.\n\"This building has not only huge architectural value, but also great cultural and historical significance,\" said Zhou. \"That is why we will only rent it. We will not sell it. It is a treasure.\"",

        "Text": "More foreign firms are finally beginning to realise the dream of the China market that has long tantalised traders -- selling goods to the world's largest slice of mankind and making money from it.\nMany foreign companies remain stuck in China ventures that are loss-making and frustrating, but the number turning a profit or at least gaining solid market share is increasing, along with the market, according to analysts and businessmen.\nIn the 16 or so years since China opened its doors to the global economy, the country has become the second-biggest recipient of foreign investment funds in the world, after the United States.\nForeign brands such as Coca-Cola, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Lux soap have become household names throughout China, and the shelves of convenience stores from Harbin to Hainan are stuffed with foreign brand soaps, chocolates and cigarettes.\nPERSISTENCE PAYS OFF\n\"Overall more and more companies are coming, which is not necessarily to say they're making money yet,\" said a Western diplomat in Shanghai. \"But there's now a general view that there's not only great potential but also an increasingly good track record for companies that have persisted.\"\n\"You can now see that if you stick it out, you can make money and you can get good market share. Coca-Cola is now a household name thoughout China,\" he added.\nCoca-Cola came back to China after a 30-year absence in 1979, and the company booked its first accounting profit for its China operations 11 years later, said John Farrell, head of China operations.\n\"You cannot afford not to be in China. It's just the reality of opening a country of this size and the size of the economy and population,\" Farrell said.\n\"But it takes a lot of patience and you need to be very diligent to build your business. It's not easy by any means.\"\nCoca-Cola has 18 bottling plants across China, and with sales volume doubling every three years this is just the beginning.\nCoca-Cola declines to say just how profitable the China market is. Like most other companies, it does not issue figures on its China operations.\nMARCHING WITH THE CONSTRAINTS\n\"You have to march along with the constraints that you're given,\" Farrell said.\n\"The main thing for us was living up to the commitments we'd made on building plants, transferring technology and training people. The more we did that, the longer we did that, the more people would believe and trust us and allow us to expand a little bit more.\"\nAmong the sectors that have done well so far are communications equipment firms, such as Motorola and Ericsson, and low-priced consumer product makers.\n\"Generally speaking, the easiest place to make a profit tends to be in the consumer industry, usually fairly small-scale operations,\" said Anne Stevenson-Yang, director of China operations for the U.S.-China Business Council.\n\"That is, assuming the deal is done right,\" she added.\nThere are big variations on market access and ease of business for foreign companies depending on the sector they are trying to storm.\nThe restraints are few in areas such as consumer products, while in sectors such as banking, distribution and insurance, foreign firms are kept on a very tight leash.\nBIGGER INVESTMENT EQUALS BIGGER RISK\nOverall, companies involved in high-cost, long-term projects seem to bear a proportionately bigger risk, analysts said.\n\"Big heavy industry projects are a problem,\" said one foreign broker in Shanghai.\n\"Generally foreign businesses in trouble have a bad business plan, or they're doing things which China is not famous for -- like trying to build aeroplanes or something.\"\nThe automobile industry has seen its share of troubles for foreign firms who have ventured in.\nChrysler Corp had a famously difficult relationship when it set up a joint venture in Beijing in the early 1980s, and France's PSA Peugeot Citroen is looking at closing one of its two China plants.\n\"We're having some difficulties -- all Western carmarkers are having difficulties in China,\" said a Peugeot official in early December.\nGeneral Motors, which has been close to completing negotiations for a $1 billion automobile factory in Shanghai for months, is well behind schedule on its plans and could have trouble ever making a profit in China, according to some analysts.\n\"It's going to be very difficult for them to make money. But they're coming in because they feel they have no choice,\" said the Western diplomat. \"It they don't do the deal, Ford will.\"\nHong Kong and Taiwan businessman have generally done much better in their investments than non-Chinese, said a representative for a Hong Kong trading group in Shanghai.\n\"But more people make money than they would admit,\" he added. \"People find ways to shift profits to Hong Kong or from one company to another to make things look like break-even.\"\nCHOOSING MARKET SHARE OVER PROFITS\nMaking money is anyway not a top priority for many companies in the China market, at least in the initial stages. Many are happy to break even or lose money for many years in order to gain market share.\nThe Canadian insurance company Manulife, for instance, which set up a joint venture last month, said it doesn't expect to see a profit for at least seven years.\n\"Many companies are ploughing everything back into expansion and advertising,\" said a Western diplomat. \"In many cases, headquarters doesn't care if you make money, it's whether you're getting greater market share.\"\n\"If you're a global company you have to be here, and the potential risk of not being here is greater than losing your shirt for a while when you come in,\" said Richard Graham, representative of ING Barings in Shanghai.\nSuccess and failure for a foreign company in China is also closely related to who they work with.\n\"The reasons for people failing are usually related to joint venture problems. Choosing the wrong partner is the source of a lot of difficulties,\" the diplomat said.\nBut analysts said profits and market share aside, major advances have been made by foreign firms in recent years in the areas of experience and staffing.\n\"There are many companies now which have a lot of experience of operations in China, their staff are more used to operating in Chinese ways, and local staff are more used to operating under international practice,\" said Barings' Graham.\n\"This should allow them to go forward more positively.\"",

So there's still a lot of technical problems. People are having trouble with access and speed once they get on,\" he added.\nA senior official with Shanghai's Post and Telecommunications Bureau said there were no longer any restrictions on Chinese people signing up for Internet access.\n\"Some time ago, our security arrangements were incomplete and there was a problem with pornographic and politically unacceptable material,\" said the official, Zhang Weihua.\n\"But our arrangements have been improved and new accounts are being added without restriction,\" he added.\nZhang said there were a total of 3,200 registered Internet accounts on the Shanghai server at the end of August with the number increasing at several hundred a month.\nBut there are indications that several other organisations are selling Internet access and the real number of users is probably much higher, analysts said.\nChinese users going through the two main servers can access the World Wide Web and use e-mail, but the Internet's freewheeling discussion news groups are restricted.\nAnd while users are able to establish their own Web sites, they are not supposed to load the material onto the Web themselves, said an attendant at one of Shanghai's two new Internet Cafes.\n\"You must give us the files to allow for inspection and we will upload them for you,\" the attendant said.\nAnalysts said the main priority of the authorities at present seemed to be to control the number of lines through which the worldwide Internet material enters China to just two -- one in Beijing and one in Shanghai.\n\"There's is upposedly another line going through from (the southern city of) Guangzhou to Hong Kong, but for political reasons, Beijing wants to keep very tight control,\" said the computer expert.\n\"I think Beijing and Shanghai will continue to be the main filtering points because otherwise they can't filter it. If they have a lot of international links then you can forget about any kind of filtering,\" he added.\nThe question, he said, is whether the Chinese authorities can stay ahead of the ever-changing technology of the Internet and ahead of the ability of local computer whiz-kids to find ways round any barriers that are set up.\n\"Given the number of hackers in China, I would say there's no way in hell (they can stay ahead),\" the expert said. \"This is a country full of hackers. These guys have found so many holes in the (Chinese) servers it's ridiculous.\"\n\"The servers don't have the latest security equipment installed and these guys are brilliant. They can see all of our e-mails. I know there are people who have all our account names and passwords,\" he added.",

Puxi, the main area of the city, is on the west side.\nPudong has so far sold 327 apartments worth 86.2 million yuan to people from outside of the city, an official of the Pudong Real Estate Exchange said.\n\"Sales of property in Puxi, despite higher prices, are hotter than in Pudong which is still seen as less convenient in terms of traffic,\" said an official of the Shanghai Real Estate Trading Centre said.\n\"Buyers from outside the city, mainly successful business people and enterprises, regard Shanghai as the best place in China to do business,\" he said.\nShanghai's economy continues to power ahead of the rest of China, with 12.8 percent growth in the first 10 months of 1996, official figures show.\nChina's GDP growth this year has been officially forecast at around 9.6-9.7 percent, compared to 10.5 percent last year.\nShanghai real estate prices have changed little in the first nine months of 1996 despite the increased sales due to a parallel growth in supply.\nThe average price of an apartment in Shanghai is now 4,020 yuan ($484.30) per square metre and office space 6,880 yuan ($828.90) per square metre, the Business News newspaper said.\n\"No one doubts that prices of property in the city will rise in the coming years,\" an analyst said.",

It ties them to a supplier, and no one likes that,\" Leishman said.  \nCanadian gold giants Barrick Gold Corp and Placer Dome Inc, both said they needed more details about the supply company before they could judge whether it would be a factor in bidding for Busang.\n\"Does this change things? Unless you know the details of the agreements, you don't know if this changes things or not,\" Barrick spokesman Vince Borg said in an interview. \"It could and it could not.\"\nBre-X would not return repeated telephone calls this week to ask for details of the Panutan agreement.  \nAnalyst Catherine Gignac at Deacon Capital Corp said the agreement is vital to Bre-X's progress.\n\"I think it's something they should have done two years ago,\" she said in an interview. \"You need a local company that's on side. You need local connections.\"\nBre-X stock shot up C$3.50 to C$24.30 on Monday after the alliance was announced, but has slid back to C$22.40 since then as investors began to realize that the Panutan deal does not solve all Bre-X's problems, analysts said.\nBre-X has been plagued by a dispute over the ownership of Busang. One of its Indonesian partners is claiming up to 40 percent of the discovery and has said he will not back down despite Bre-X's alliance with Suharto's son.\nThe Indonesian government has vowed not to issue essential contracts of work until Bre-X sorts out its problems.

Gold was up slightly in London on Thursday at $356.60.\nGold prices have slumped to three-year lows on a strong U.S. dollar, booming financial markets, low inflation, rising mine production and rumors of central bank selling.\nMost analysts said the yellow metal was headed further south, but there was no consensus on the extent of the decline or when prices might recover.\nThe heavily weighted gold index in Toronto, Canada's biggest stock market, has dropped with the price of the metal, losing more than nine percent since Dec. 30.\nCanada's biggest gold companies, Barrick Gold Corp. and Placer Dome Inc. have followed suit.\nBarrick, the world's third largest gold producer, closed at C$35.55 on Wednesday, down from C$39.50 on Dec. 30. The stock rose slightly on Thursday to C$35.75. In New York, Barrick has fallen to 26-3/8 from 28-7/8 on Dec. 30.\nVancouver-based Placer Dome fell to a 52-week low of C$27.05 on Wednesday from C$30.90 on Dec. 30. It was up C$0.30 to C$27.35 on Thursday. In New York, Placer fell to 20-1/4 on Thursday from 22-5/8 on Dec. 30.\nU.S. gold producers have also been hit. Newmont Mining Corp. was trading at 40 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, versus 45-1/4 on Dec. 30. Homestake Mining Co. was at 13 5/8 on Thursday in New York, down from 14-1/4 on Dec. 30.\nTraditionally, Toronto gold stocks move up in tandem with the gold price, but do not react as strongly to a price decline.\nDiscoveries, takeover rumors and news from exploration companies that share the Toronto gold index with major producers generally temper the index's reaction to price slumps.\nThat is not the case now.\n\"At this point in time, the market is not even paying attention to special situations,\" said Fathi.\nOn Wednesday, almost every stock in the Toronto gold index fell except for diamond companies.\nMidland Walwyn's Jalonen predicted Toronto golds would lose a further five percent before they stabilized.\nDiversified producers such as Vancouver-based Teck Corp. were not as vulnerable as pure gold producers to steep drops in the gold price, Jalonen noted.",

The companies were asked to consider giving the Indonesian government 10 percent in the rich find.\nAs the clocked ticked, Bre-X issued a statement saying no new deadline had been set by the Indonesian Mines Ministry.\nIn Jakarta, a senior Indonesian mines official said the government of President Suharto would explore other possibilities to develop Busang if the two companies fail to clinch a deal.\n\"If they cannot reach an agreement, the government will take the necessary and appropriate action ... to expedite the development of Busang's resouces,\" Umar Said, secretary-general of the Mines Department, told a news conference in Jakarta.\n\"What the action will be ... I have to get back to the government. This is not my playground,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, investors pushed up Bre-X's stock by C$1.40 to C$20.10 ($14.90) in heavy trading in Toronto Wednesday, while Barrick rose C$1.10 to C$38.95 ($28.85).\n\"People think there's an agreement that will come out sooner rather than later,\" said gold analyst Catherine Gignac of Deacon Capital in Toronto.\nBut she noted that the uncertainty surrounding the negotiations was preventing Bre-X's stock from rising to meet the level of rumoured offers of C$25 ($18.50) a share from Barrick.\n\"We're actually hearing that (the deal) is done and they're just dotting the i's and crossing the t's,\" Gignac said. \"Everything has been set. We just don't know the details.\"\nBut a source close to the negotiations said he understood that the two companies did not have a deal and were trying to get a deadline extension from the Indonesian government.\nThe latest deadline, if passed, would be the second the two companies missed. They let a deadline at the end of November slip by too, sources said.\nPossible stumbling blocks in the talks include price, how to pay for the deal and a series of threatened lawsuits over Bre-X's claims, analysts said.\nWaiting to pounce on the deposit if the Indonesian government does open the door to outside bidding is another North American gold giant -- Placer Dome Inc., which seemed to be positioning itself in case the Barrick, Bre-X talks fail.\n\"I don't think today's deadline had any great significance,\" Placer spokesman Hugh Leggatt said in Vancouver, British Columbia. He added that the company still hoped to be allowed to partner with Bre-X to develop Busang.\n\"We're not discouraged. It's going to be a long process,\" he said.\nNewmont Mining Corp. and Teck Corp. also expressed an interest in Busang, which is located deep in the jungle in East Kalimantan on the island of Borneo.",

Busang II contains most of the gold found so far on the property.\nBut earlier on Thursday, Umar repeated his comments to Reuters in Jakarta casting Bre-X's status in doubt.\nIndonesian mining officials told Reuters in Jakarta that they had stopped processing Bre-X's applications for vital contracts of work on the gold find. Instead, Bre-X and Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp. must jointly submit new applications for the permits.\n\"The government has stopped processing the previous application for contracts of work by Bre-X because of various problems,\" Umar said. \"Therefore, the previous application by Bre-X that has been delayed must be stopped and must be said to have been cancelled.\"\nWhile mining officials were explaining their position in Jakarta, Bre-X was issuing optimistic statements.\nBre-X said it appeared that the development of Busang was \"possibly open to negotiation\" and that draft documents showed it had exclusive operating rights to Busang.\nThe Indonesian government encouraged Bre-X in November to form a joint venture with Barrick, with Barrick getting 75 percent of the joint venture, Bre-X keeping 25 percent and the two companies granting the Indonesian government a 10 percent stake.\nBut Bre-X said on Thursday that \"the government of Indonesia appears to be seriously reconsidering its earlier decision that would have compelled Bre-X into a partnership with Barrick.\"\nBre-X cited a published report that suggested Indonesian President Suharto was ready to intervene in the process.\nBre-X and Barrick said last week they reached agreement on some points to form a joint venture for Busang, but outstanding issues remained and no overall agreement had been settled.\nBut Bre-X was still hopeful on Thursday that the negotiations for Busang could be opened up to an auction process.\n\"We have believed from the outset that the best interests of the Indonesian people and their economy would best be served by a truly open negotiation process for the development of this extraordinary natural resource,\" Walsh said in a letter to Indonesia's Minister of Mines.\nBre-X shares were still halted on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The company requested a halt on Wednesday so it could clarify statements from Jakarta. The stock closed Tuesday at C$20.50.",

The government, which also requested a 10 percent stake, set a Dec. 4 deadline, but the two companies announced after that date that several issues remained outstanding.\nSince then, the Indonesian government has raised doubts about Bre-X's grip on Busang, estimated to contain at least 57 million ounces of gold, worth about $21 billion at today's prices.\n\"The government has stopped processing the previous application for contracts of work by Bre-X because of various problems,\" Umar Said, Indonesia's secretary-general of mines, told Reuters in Jakarta on Thursday. \"Therefore the previous application by Bre-X that has been delayed must be stopped and must be said to have been cancelled.\"\nHe said Bre-X and Barrick must jointly submit new applications for work on the deposit.

He said Bre-X had not made a formal request for an auction, but added: \"We understand that the president is reviewing the situation.\"\nAn auction would be advantageous for Bre-X shareholders and for Indonesia, he said. \"We're not soliciting offers. We are getting other phone calls,\" Walsh said. \"I am talking to principals of other companies.\"\nHe said he had spoken to executives at Placer Dome Inc., Newmont Mining Corp. and Teck Corp.\nIn Vancouver, Placer Dome spokesman Hugh Leggatt said any suggestion of an open auction on Busang was encouraging. His company has made a formal request for an open bidding process.\nBut gold mining analyst Bill Belovay of CIBC Wood Gundy said Barrick's competitors may be trying to make a deal with Bre-X more expensive for Barrick. \"They're playing games,\" he said. \"One has got to read between the lines.\"\nBelovay said Busang was so fraught with uncertainty that he has a hard time understanding why the major gold producers would be interested. \"One doesn't even know what percentage (Barrick) will end up with.

        "Text": "Royal Oak Mines Inc is reshaping its operations to concentrate on its low-cost gold deposits in the Timmins area and British Columbia, the company president said Wednesday.\n\"We have refocused our strategy to bring on very low-cost production,\" Peggy Witte said in an analysts' conference call. \"It's very clear that's where Royal Oak's future lies.\"  \nThe Kirkland, Washington-based gold producer said Wednesday it will close down its mine in Hope Brook, Newfoundland, and write down the reserves at its Colomac mine in the Northwest Territories.\nRoyal Oak expects to take C$37.4 million in charges because of the Hope Brook and Colomac decisions. After tax, the charges will amount to a decrease in net income of about C$27 million or C$0.19 a share in the fourth quarter of 1996.\nThe company plans to move most of the mining and mill assets from Hope Brook to its Matachewan project in northern Ontario.  \n\"It's a very positive story for us being able to redeploy those assets, and we did not want to spread our senior management too thin,\" Witte said, explaining the decision.\nHope Brook will shut down in the third quarter of 1997, while Matachewan is expected to start production in the second half of 1998, Royal Oak said.\nThe company recently increased its gold reserves at its Timmins and Matachewan properties, decided to expand its Pamour Mill and is putting together a feasibility study for an expanded open pit in the area.  \nThe northern Ontario mines, along with production expected in 1998 from the Kemess copper and gold mine in British Columbia, will boost production and decrease costs significantly for Royal Oak, said chief financial officer Jim Wood.\nThe company expects to produce 375,000 ounces at a cash costs of US$325 an ounce in 1997. In 1998, production will rise to 500,000 ounces at a cost of US$250 or US$260 an ounce. By 1999, the company expects up to 750,000 ounces at about US$240 an ounce, and in 2000, production should be almost one million ounces with costs in the low US$200s, Wood said.  \n\"Although we have closed out Hope Brook cash costs are somewhat disappointing at Colomac, the future of the company, with the Pamour expansion, looks very bright for us in terms of production and our average cash costs,\" he said.\nThe company reported third quarter profits of C$10.2 million or C$0.07 a share, up from C$6.2 million or C$0.05 a share a year earlier.\nGold production rose 13 percent in the quarter to 104,012 ounces from 92,159 ounces during the third quarter last year.\nThe increase came from the Pamour mine in Northern Ontario, which produced higher grade ore.  \nRevenue was 48 percent higher in the third quarter, mainly because of a successful hedging program. The company realized a gold price of US$543 per ounce, compared to US$418 an ounce at the same time last year.\nRoyal Oak expects to produce about 400,000 ounces of gold in 1996 at a cash cost of US$335 an ounce. The lower production level and increase in cash cost from previous estimates are a result of lower grade ore at Colomac.",

        "Text": "Canadian gold giant Barrick Gold Corp is the most likely contender to partner junior mining company Bre-X Minerals Ltd in developing its huge Indonesian gold deposit, analysts polled by Reuters said.\n\"We really only have one potential front runner: Barrick,\" said gold analyst Barry Allan with Gordon Capital.\nBarrick has demonstrated its interest in Indonesian gold by investing more than US$10 million in exploration and amassing a large land position in Indonesia, analysts said.  \nAnd Barrick's association with a construction company run by the daughter of Indonesia's President Suharto suggests Barrick is carefully setting up its network to control a piece or all of the Busang, Bre-X's 47-million-ounce discovery in the middle of the jungles of Borneo.\n\"They're trying to position themselves the best they can,\" said one analyst who did not want to be named.  \nAnalysts who have been closely watching developments around Busang,said Barrick stands the best chance of bidding successfully for a stake in the property because Barrick's own high-priced stock, relative to the value of its assets, will look attractive to Bre-X shareholders.\n\"In order to pay the sort of multiples Bre-X is trading at, you have to have a high gold multiple in order to land the company or the property at these prices,\" said Rick Cohen at Goepel Shields in Vancouver.  \nBre-X shareholders will likely look for a combination of cash and shares so they can keep a stake in the fortunes of Busang, analysts said.\nBre-X is looking for a heavyweight mining company to buy all or part of the Busang discovery and act as operator of what is expected to become one of the world's biggest gold mines. But the search has been dogged by a dispute with Bre-X's Indonesian partners over ownership.\nThe spat has caused the Indonesian government to delay granting Bre-X essential contracts of work needed to develop Busang. Without the contracts, analysts said a bid for Bre-X would be unlikely.  \nBre-X has refused to speak to the media since it forged an alliance with Indonesian President Suharto's son last week. But some analysts said Bre-X told them recently the dispute should be cleared up this month.\nWhile Barrick is at the top of the list of companies who could afford to buy into Bre-X, Vancouver-based Placer Dome Inc also has the resources and the attractive stock price to make a bid, analyst Cohen pointed out.\n\"The size of this deposit and the potential involved here sort of limits it to those two,\" he said.\nOthers said the Bre-X play was not Placer Dome's style.  \n\"Definitely Placer has the capability to do it. I just don't think they have the stomach for it,\" said Allan.\nNewmont Gold Co, RTZ Corp PLC, Minorco SA and Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc could also be in the running for Bre-X. However, their chances are not as good as Barrick's, analysts said, noting that Newmont, Freeport and RTZ already have large exposure in Indonesia.  \nWhile the Luxemburg-based Minorco, controlled by Anglo American Corp of South Africa  ANGL.J., has recently raised US$400 million, the company's stock lacks the high multiple that would make it attractive to Bre-X shareholders.\nMinorco could run into political problems if it were to make a bid for Bre-X, said one South African analyst who follows Minorco closely.\n\"The South Africans might not want to get into a situation that's so blatantly political,\" he said. \"It might backfire on them.\"  \nIf Barrick does eventually succeed in controlling the Busang deposit, it would go a long way to fulfilling Barrick chief executive Peter Munk's dream of building the world's largest gold company to supplant Anglo American, analysts said.\n\"It fits very nicely with Munk's strategy,\" said one analyst. \"Munk is not driven by money. He wants to have a legacy. He wants to be able to say he started with nothing and ended with the largest gold company in the world.",

Tuesday, solidifying its position as the world's third biggest gold producer.\n\"We are pleased that Arequipa shareholders have chosen so overwhelmingly to accept this offer,\" Barrick Chairman Peter Munk said in a statement. \"We now have the opportunity to realize the potential of Arequipa's excellent assets.\"\nA total of 93 percent of Arequipa shareholders accepted Barrick's C$30 ($21.94) a share bid overnight, and Barrick said it plans to exercise its right to buy the remaining shares.\nBarrick said it will have to spend at least C$512 million ($374 million) and issue about 13.4 million shares to complete the takeover, giving the deal a total value of C$1.02 billion ($745 million) based on the closing price for Barrick stock Tuesday.\nThe acquisition gives Barrick, North America's largest gold mining company, ownership of Arequipa's prize possession, the Pierina gold deposit in Peru.\nWhile exploration on the property is in its early stages, some experts have speculated the deposit has potential reserves of up to 12 million ounces of high-quality gold.\nBarrick originally offered Arequipa shareholders C$27 a share July 11 to take over the Vancouver-based company. Analysts initially saw the offer as generous since exploration at Pierina was preliminary.\nBut Arequipa recently released a fresh batch of drill results from the property, attracting interest from other potential bidders.\nOn Aug. 16, Barrick raised its offer to C$30 a share to pre-empt a takeover battle.\nMore drill results were expected soon.\nHours after Barrick officials got the news that the takeover offer had succeeded, two top executives in charge of exploration left to take a closer look at their new treasure.\n\"They're on their way to Lima right now, to start work on Pierina,\" said company spokesman Vincent Borg. \"What's next is to get a handle on the ore body.\"\nDrilling on the property will continue at an accelerated pace, he said. Barrick also plans to send in additional drill rigs and prepare for engineering work leading up to an eventual feasibility study.\n\"Things will start kicking in,\" Borg said.\nAnalysts were also on their way to Vancouver to scrutinize data collected by Arequipa that Barrick has not yet seen.\nFunding the takeover will not be a problem, Borg added. \"We've got a very strong balance sheet. We've got no long-term debt.\"\nBut the company will have to pay interest on its line of credit and bump up its exploration budget to uncover the metal at Pierina, cutting into earnings, one analyst said.\nThe Arequipa acquisition was a very \"aggressive\" move for Barrick and signals the start of a bold, new expansion strategy for the gold giant, mining experts said.\n\"I don't think they'll stop here. I think they'll continue on the acquisition track,\" one said.\nBarrick would not say if it had its eye on another property. But the company has said in the past it plans to make more than one acquisition.",

It will probably be like that in the future.\"\nHowever, Hushovd is not content simply to sit back and let the long-term strategic plan unfold.\nThe plan calls for Falconbridge to double its annual nickel production to 200,000 tonnes and triple its copper production to about 500,000 tonnes a year, within 15 years.\nTo do that, Falconbridge needs to find growth opportunities, especially since the company lost a bid to take over the huge Voisey's Bay nickel, copper and cobalt deposit in remote Labrador, said Hushovd.\nOngoing work in New Caledonia, Ivory Coast and Zambia should complement plans to start producing nickel by the end of next year at the Raglan project in Quebec and plans to produce copper by 1998 at the Collahuasi joint venture project in Chile, Hushovd said.\nIn Zambia, Falconbridge joined a consortium in November to develop the Konkola Deep copper mine, in which Falconbridge is partners with South Africa's Gencor Ltd and Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd.\nIn New Caledonia in the South Pacific, Falconbridge is poised to gain access to nickel reserves to supply a nickel plant planned in the north of the country. The board of France's Eramet on Thursday said it had agreed to reallocate its mining reserves in New Caledonia, which would give Falconbridge access to Eramet's Koniambo field.\nHushovd does not intend not stop there.\n\"Falconbridge has always been very strong in exploration,\" he said. \"We felt we lacked the business development infrastructure.\"\nSo last summer, the company set up a business development group, to search out growth opportunities either through exploration or acquisition.\nWhile Hushovd would not hint at specific acquisition targets, he stressed, \"I want properties that are not only profitable today but are also profitable in the future.\"\nIn any future acquisitions, Falconbridge can probably count on support from its powerful majority shareholder, Noranda Inc, which owns 46 percent.\n\"We have a big owner, which means that hopefully we can pursue things that might be tough to pursue on our own,\" Hushovd said. \"We can have a bigger appetite than the company on its own would have.\"\nHushovd said he had no immediate plans to boost the company's share price, which peaked at C$32.75 in May but is currently trading around C$29.15.\nHe noted that the stock normally reflects the nickel price, which has failed to meet expectations in 1996.\n\"I think we all had very high hopes for nickel this year, and the market did not turn out the way that we had forecasted,\" he said.\nAs for next year, \"I feel it's difficult to give a prediction at the present time. Fundamentally I do believe we're going to see better prices in 97 than we did in 96,\" Hushovd said.",

Every week we're hitting stuff,\" said Soper, waving his arm to point at the vast stretch of bog and thin forest surrounding the round, rocky hill where metals were discovered two years ago.  \nInco's most recent calculations, compiled in an internal report at the end of August, showed 138 million tonnes of resource (corrects from \"proven or probable reserves\") spread out over three different deposits at the Voisey's Bay property. Resources are potential reserves.\nOn average, the deposits graded 2.09 percent nickel, 1.24 percent copper and 0.99 percent cobalt, the report said.\nAt the Ovoid deposit, found close to the surface of a bog close to the Labrador Sea, drilling has outlined 37.5 million tonnes. Exploration is finished at the Ovoid and Inco now plans to mine the area through an open pit mine.  \nThe Eastern Deeps, which lies under a series of hills covered with sparse trees and lush moss, has not yet been defined.\nRecent calculations showed 75.5 million tonnes of ore, but the deposit was open in all directions.\nTo the west of the Ovoid, in the Western Extension, drills are uncovering another rich deposit. The mineralization was uncovered last April, after Diamond Fields Resources Inc, the owner of Voisey's Bay, accepted Inco's C$4.3 billion takeover offer.  \nSo far, drilling has defined 24.7 million tonnes, but the deposit is growing steadily.\nBoth the Eastern Deeps and the Western Extension need extremely deep holes to strike significant metal, and each major hole takes about three weeks to drill, said Soper.\nMore than 340 holes have been completed so far, with a total drilling meterage of more than 135,000 metres, Inco said in its recent mine and mill project description.\n\"Over half of our holes are good. They're mineralized,\" said 25-year-old geologist Mary Vaughan as she examined a new box of core samples just brought in from the Eastern Deeps.  \n\"It just blows you away. It's an explorationist's dream.\"\nArchean Resources plans to keep drilling at a breakneck pace until its contract ends in December.\nInco has not said whether it will extend Archean's contract, but the Toronto-based company has promised to spend C$20 million over the next four years on exploration.\nOnly five percent of the property has been explored so far, but small exploration companies that have claims surrounding Inco's 495-square-kilometre site have not found anything significant.  \nNew resource calculations are expected within the next month, Rick Gill, spokesman for Inco subsidiary Voisey's Bay Nickel Co told Reuters in St. John's, Newfoundland.\nMining at Voisey's Bay is expected to last at least 20 years, with a concentrator on site handling 15,000 tonnes of ore a day. Mining will likely continue all year round, despite high winds, extremely cold temperatures and thick ice that locks in the site for a few months every winter.\n\"The information that we have at this time suggests it will be possible to operate year 'round with ice breaker support,\" said Gill.",

The companies were invited to consider giving the Indonesian government 10 percent of the rich find.\nAs the clocked ticked, Bre-X issued a statement saying no new deadline had been set by the Indonesian Mines Ministry. It said it expected the Ministry of Mines to clarify its stand on the outstanding issues \"in due course.\"\nThe direction of negotiations is in the hands of the Indonesian government, Walsh said.\n\"We are waiting on the answers we get from the Minister of Mines,\" he said.\nSources close to the talks said Indonesian mining officials had left Jakarta and would not be back until Dec. 9.\n\"I think both sides are probably worried about the so-called deadline, which has come and gone,\" said gold analyst John Ing with Maison Placements Canada Inc. \"It's back in the lap of the Indonesians.\"\nIn Jakarta, a senior Indonesian mines official said the government of President Suharto would explore other possibilities to develop Busang if the two companies fail to clinch a deal.\n\"If they cannot reach an agreement, the government will take the necessary and appropriate action ... to expedite the development of Busang's resouces,\" Umar Said, secretary-general of the Mines Department, told a news conference in Jakarta.\n\"What the action will be ...

We just don't know the details.\"\nBut a source close to the negotiations said he understood that the two companies did not have a deal and were trying to get a deadline extension from the Indonesian government.\nThe latest deadline is the second the two companies missed. They let a deadline at the end of November slip by too, sources said.\nPossible stumbling blocks in the talks include price, how to pay for the deal and a series of threatened lawsuits over Bre-X's claims, analysts said.\nWaiting to pounce on the deposit if the Indonesian government does open the door to outside bidding is another North American gold giant -- Placer Dome Inc., which seemed to be positioning itself in case the Barrick, Bre-X talks fail.\n\"I don't think today's deadline had any great significance,\" Placer spokesman Hugh Leggatt said in Vancouver, British Columbia. He added that the company still hoped to be allowed to form a partnership with Bre-X to develop Busang.\n\"We're not discouraged.

Family members had been under surveillance for several weeks, she added.\nThe former student leader, who vanished into detention in May 1995, faces a minimum 10-year sentence and a maximum penalty of death.\nThe court has refused to give details of Wang's trial except to say he has been charged with plotting to overthrow the government.\nThe New York-based Human Rights Watch said last week the chances of acquittal were slim because Wang has not had adequate time to prepare a defence.\nHis family found a lawyer willing to defend the dissident after being given just one day in which to do so.\nWang's mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, would attend the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister would be allowed to sit in.\nThe mother has said the dissident was calm and mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, although she has said his health had deteriorated during his detention.\nHuman Rights Watch attacked the trial on Tuesday as a sign of the Chinese leadership's increasing intolerance of dissent.\n\"The fact is that China's urban dissident movement... has in effect been comprehensively smashed,\" it said in a statement.\n\"At least where political dissidents are concerned, all the judicial signs thus far point... to intensified repression by the country's state security forces,\" it said, calling for a freeze on trade missions from the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia.\nThe human rights group said Chinese criminal trials seldom respect the presumption of innocence, and defence lawyers were generally restricted to arguing mitigating circumstances for a reduced sentence.\nWang's court appearance would likely be held out of the public eye, as was last year's trial of Wei Jingsheng, regarded as the father of China's tiny, struggling democracy movement.\nOfficials have been silent on a request by the U.S. embassy in Beijing to send observers to Wang's trial, diplomats said.\nFrench senator Robert Badinter, former U.S. attorneys general Nicholas Katzenback and Richard Thornburgh, and former Canadian solicitor-general Warren Allmand have also said they want to observe Wang's trial.\nForeign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang on Tuesday shrugged off questions from reporters about the status of the requests, saying Wang's trial was China's internal affair.\nBeijing has repeatedly come under fire from the West for human rights abuses. It says foreign intervention in China's internal affairs is not welcome.\nWang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.\nHe was politically active again after his parole in 1993, defying police surveillance to join a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of those still jailed for their part in the 1989 protests.\nChina has recently cracked down on the few remaining dissidents who have not fled into exile or been jailed.",

The United States insists that the size of China's economy ranks it as a developed country.\n\"This is a matter of principle,\" Pei said.\nChina was deeply disappointed when its application to join the world trade body as a founding member two years ago failed, and talks since in Geneva have proceeded at a snail's pace.\nHe said he expected little progress when ministers of the WTO's 125 member states meet in Singapore this week, with China attending under observer status, but said China would seize the opportunity to explain its stand in meetings on the sidelines.\n\"After we gain recognition of our status then the talks could more easily proceed,\" Pei said. \"There may be the possibility of concessions (by China) on some concrete issues.\"\nPei declined to say where China might be prepared to offer concessions in line with a \"road map\" presented to Beijing by Washington outlining liberalisations it wants before it will support Chinese membership.\nHe said China's economy was already remarkably open compared with some of its neighbours such as Japan and South Korea.\n\"When you go shopping in Beijing you see goods from all over the world on every shelf,\" he said. \"You don't see nearly so many Chinese products on foreign shelves.\"\nChinese President Jiang Zemin announced at the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum last month in the Philippines that China would slash average import tariffs to 15 percent by 2000 from the current 23 percent.\nPei said non-tariff barriers still existed in China, citing the service sector as one area to which foreign firms were eager to gain admittance, but insisted Beijing was gradualling pulling down these barriers.\n\"Opening up requires a process,\" he said. \"It is a fact that China is a backward country and must protect some parts of its economy. The demands on us must not be too harsh.\"\nPei offered a less optimistic view than China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen who has said talks with the United States on entry could be wrapped up by mid-1997 as well as WTO chief Renato Ruggiero who has said next year could see a solution to the exclusion of the world's most populous nation from the world trade body.\nPei said 1997 seemed a rather ambitious target given the distance between the United States and China on many issues, but said he hoped to see entry by 1999.\n\"There are both advantages and disadvantages to China from entry to the WTO,\" Pei said, setting off the access to worldwide markets for Chinese goods against the cost and competition its domestic industry would face.\n\"China's stand now is that it is up to the other side,\" Pei said.\n\"China actively wants membership but it can wait. It will be good for China to enter but it won't be a catastrophe if we have to wait,\" he said.\n\"It is in no one's interests to keep China out.\"",

China has not formally objected to the film.\nHowever, it has apparently tried to halt production by California-based Walt Disney of the film \"Kundun\" that tells of the Dalai Lama's early life and is directed by Scorsese. Mathison Ford is a scriptwriter for the movie.\nDisney has said it will go ahead with the release of \"Kundun\" despite China's objections. Beijing has denied putting pressure on Disney to withdraw backing for the film.\nBeijing has been reported to have warned Walt Disney last month that its ambitious business plans in China were at risk if it went ahead with the release of the movie.\nA Foreign Ministry spokesman said Disney would be wrong to sing the praises of the exiled spiritual leader.\nThe Dalai Lama fled Tibet to India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule and has since waged a non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland.\nHowever, the blacklist did not include actor Richard Gere, who has long backed the Tibetan spiritual movement and is an active supporter of the Dalai Lama, the tourism official said.\nGere was among a group of movie luminaries who this month wrote to China's ambassador in Washington protesting against what they called Beijing's \"attempt to impose worldwide censorship\".\nOfficials had begun to compile a blacklist of foreigners barred from visiting the restive area in 1993, and the list had now reached more than 50 names, he said.\nAll foreign visitors to Tibet are required first to obtain an entry permit issued by local authorities who are anxious to keep out Westerners who may support the underground pro-independence movement spearheaded by the region's monks.",

It has also made its first net profit.\nManager Li Jishan glowed with pride as he described the modernisation wrought at his plant over the last few years.\n\"When I first came here in 1961 things were really backward. We lived in tents. Can you imagine?\" he said in an interview with Reuters.\nThe leather factory was moved to Lhasa in 1959 from Golmud in neighbouring Qinghai province to provide footleather for thousands of soldiers sent to garrison Tibet after an abortive uprising by Tibetans seeking independence in 1958.\nAs a state-owned firm that processes yak skins into shoes and handbags it had little incentive to turn a profit. That is slowly changing.\nLast year, the China-Germany Joint Venture Lhasa Leather Factory of Tibet reported a profit of 200,000 yuan ($24,000) -- a modest sum but the first in its history.\n\"We have a good future, our efficiency is good...and with German assistance we are placing great emphasis on environmental protection,\" said Li, adding that he expected another profit this year.\n\"The German side is very strict, especially on environmental protection,\" he noted. \"But we get along with them very well.\"\nOne problem identified by the German side is one common to most of China's state-owned firms -- the huge surplus labour that is the legacy of jobs-for-life socialism.\n\"We have had arguments with the German experts who want to fire someone, for example,\" said Li. \"But they have come to understand our point of view and our system.\"\nHowever, German officials still warn that keeping on a couple of hundred extra staff is bound to affect profits.\nGerman officials said the plant had been an environmental disaster when they arrived, with its tannery spouting stinking waste into the nearby rushing Tolungchu river.\n\"It was in really bad shape with terrible environmental problems,\" said Niels von Keyserlingk, director of the office of the German Development Corporation in Beijing that oversees aid to the plant.\n\"Before, the water was untreated and flowed into the river causing many problems,\" he said. \"But things have been very nicely done. There is no pollution.\"\nAll chemicals are recycled now and a German-manufactured system cleans the water, separating waste that is dried for use by local farmers as fertiliser.\n\"The water that flows into the river is absolutely clean,\" said von Keyserlingk, who visited the plant last May.\nA cement factory on the opposite bank belching dust into the clear mountain area could pose a new environmental hazard.\nGermany has given 15 million deutschemarks ($9.8 million) in aid to the plant, which has been allowed to register as a joint venture and thus qualifies for the generous tax breaks and holidays that Tibet offers to foreign investors.\nGerman money has helped to buy the latest in leather processing machinery as well as sewing machines, waste elimination plants and even new solar energy panels that are heating water for the factory.\nSales have soared. The factory held an eight percent share of the Tibet shoe market for years, but in 1994 that jumped to 20 percent and nearly doubled again in 1995 to a 36 percent market share.\n\"Our products are really popular because they are all leather, and people want that kind of quality,\" Li said.\nThe factory is trying to boost sales to the rest of China as well as overseas exports, particularly to neighbouring Nepal.\nBut it faces awesome transport handicaps in shipping goods from a city that has no rail links and must send merchandise more than 1,000 km (600 miles) over some of China's most difficult roads to the nearest railway station.\n\"We still need to raise quality and produce more different styles of shoes to compete in the market,\" said Li, who has clearly picked up some tips from his German market-savvy experts.\n\"Either you learn to swim in the market or you drown.\"",

Just two involved international affairs.\nPresident Jiang's visit to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in the Philippines last month edged into fifth place.\nJiang's APEC meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton set the seal on a warming of frosty Sino-U.S. ties and resulted in a decision on an exchange of the first presidential state visits in nearly eight years. But for China's news commissars, that merited only a brief aside.\n\"Chinese President Jiang Zemin... met with leaders of other APEC members, including U.S. President Clinton,\" Xinhua said.\nChina's renewed crackdown on dissent, such as its decision to sentence Wang Dan, a former leader of the 1989 student demonstrations for more democracy, to 11 years in jail for conspiring to subvert the government, went unmentioned.",

We are just waiting for new developments,\" the relative told Reuters.\nThe outspoken activist attracted the ire of China's communist authorities in 1989 when he shot to prominence as a leader of student protests for more democracy centred on Tiananmen Square in the heart of the Chinese capital.\nWang had been expected to face new charges since last December, when the court that convicted veteran democracy activist Wei Jingsheng -- a nominee for this year's Nobel Peace Prize -- of plotting to overthrow the government also implicated the former student leader.\nThe court's verdict said Wei, who was jailed for 14 years, had links with people \"convicted of counter-revolutionary crimes, including Wang Dan\". It also referred to a tape-recorded conversation between Wang and Wei, but gave no details.\nWang had been active since his release from jail, defying persistent police surveillance and harassment to join in a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.",

Differences appeared to narrow between North and South as well as North and North on standards to regulate cheap labour and child workers.\nWTO officials want a final declaration at the close of the first ministerial meeting of the fledgling trade body on Friday that would point the WTO down the free trade path into the 21st century.\nThe EU, along with the United States, Canada and Japan, were making progress to reach consensus on an Information Technology Agreement (ITA) that would be the crowning achievement of the meeting, EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan told reporters.\n\"We are making a lot of progress,\" Brittan said after a lunchtime meeting of the four major trading partners to discuss types of products to be covered and timing of tariff reductions.\nActing U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefksy said she concurred with Brittan's comments, but declined to say anything more on the proposed pact to remove tariffs on computer products by 2000.\nLate night talks focused on details, officials said.\n\"There is no question that what the industrialised countries now hope for most here is a deal on information technology products and agreement to work hard for a basic telecommunications pact by February,\" said one key negotiator.\nSignals from negotiators left little doubt the major traders were aiming for agreement as quickly as possible -- perhaps by Wednesday -- to convince Asian trading partners to sign on to the agreement by the end of the meeting on Friday.\nJapan's Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda told the conference he hoped \"ardently....that we will have an agreement as the most significant achievement of this ministerial conference in the area of trade liberalisation.\"\nHowever, several Asian nations voiced reservations, with Malaysia saying the goal of free commerce in infotech by the turn of the century was too ambitious.\n\"We did not come here to discuss the Information Technology Agreement,\" international trade and industry minister Rafidah Aziz said. \"All negotiations should be done in Geneva.\"\nThe 128 full delegations from WTO member countries and ministers and officials from nearly 30 others waiting to be admitted heard ringing appeals for progress to a telecoms liberalisation pact with a deadline set for mid-February.\nAnother late night meeting was called on the \"new issue\" of labour standards that has emerged as the most divisive in Singapore.\nA Japanese foreign ministry official told reporters that some developing countries who had opposed any mention of the labour issue in the final declaration were taking a more positive position.\n\"A possibility of an agreement has emerged,\" he said, but addded that some hard-core emerging economies were holding out.\nIndia, Malaysia and Indonesia, for example, have been insisting on no mention at all, arguing that even a neutral phrasing would suggest work conditions were a subject for the WTO.\nAccord was also closer on whether to study competition policy.\n\"No one was totally opposed to taking up the issue,\" a Japanese official sid. \"We are moving towards a compromise.\"\nAiming to counter lobbying by sceptical Western-based aid groups, the WTO insisted that the poorest nations stood to reap major benefit from the freeing of global commerce.\nBut WTO officials admitted that Director-General Renato Ruggiero had failed to convince richer members, both industrialised and emerging economies, to remove all tariffs and other barriers affecting goods from the laggard states.\nThe European Union made little headway in efforts to persuade its main trading partners to jump-start stalled talks on China's bid for WTO admission.\nBut Russia, another major member-in-waiting, expected to win entry by the end of 1997, Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Davydov said.",

Security Council veto in nearly 24 years.\nTaiwan has given generous economic aid to several small, impoverished states around the world in its bid to break out of a diplomatic isolation imposed by China. Taiwan was expelled from the U.N. in 1971 and replaced by Beijing as the rightful representative of China.\nUnder the peace accord, Guatemala's army would redeploy units to specified locations, after which troops from the rebel Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit (URNG) would move to eight assembly points and disarm. The U.N. observers were to verify the process.\nThe drafters of the resolution -- the United States, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Spain and Norway --  decided to push ahead with the vote, despite China's threat of a veto, saying that further talks could not overcome the differences.\nChina had never spelled out publicly what Guatemala was expected to do. But diplomats said it sought a pledge to refrain from sponsoring further pro-Taiwan U.N. resolutions and to stop receiving high-ranking Taiwanese visitors.",

How can they do this?,\" she said. \"He did not do anything illegal. All he did was exercise his freedom of speech... Citizens have freedom of speech...\"\nShe said she had not yet decided whether to appeal on his behalf.\nThe administrative punishment was passed against Liu just hours after he was taken from his Beijing home early on Tuesday by a group of uniformed and plainclothes police, with a search warrant, who also confiscated books, papers and photographs.\n\"Re-education through labour is the personal power of the public security bureau, it doesn't have to go through judicial departments,\" Liu Xia said. \"The public security can just do as they wish.\"\nPolice officials declined to comment.\nThe administrative punishment of re-education through labour has been increasingly used against dissidents in recent months as a means of removing activists from circulation while avoiding the more complicated trial process, diplomats say.\nPolice gave no reason for the detention of Liu, a renowned literary critic who gained fame as a dissident in the 1989 student-led pro-democracy movement that was crushed by the military with heavy loss of life.\nLiu has been active in recent months, sending several daring, open letters to the government.\nOn September 30, Liu and Wang issued a statement urging China's communist authorities to honour a promise in 1945 to give people freedom of the press and speech and to form political parties and stage demonstrations.\nIn a bold move, the two demanded Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin be indicted, impeached and step down for violating the constitution for saying the People's Liberation Army was under the \"absolute leadership\" of the party instead of the state.\nWang did not return home on Tuesday and his wife said she was very worried because he had not responded to his pager.\nWang was paroled in 1993 after serving 12 years of a 14-year term for sedition and remains deprived of his political rights. He is one of China's most outspoken proponents of democracy.\nLiu was last detained by police in 1995 after orchestrating several daring petitions to parliament by dissidents and intellectuals in the early months of the year. He was held for seven months without charges until being released in January.\nHis sentence comes shortly after Chinese sources said dissident and former student leader Wang Dan faced a second jail term after prosecutors charged him recently with subversion.\nWang, 26, faces up to seven years in jail on charges of counter-revolutionary incitement -- or subversion.\nWang, who is believed to have worked with Liu on several daring petitions, was detained in May, 1995 in the run-up to the sixth anniversary of the June 1989 military crackdown.",

He declined to give details although several smaller bombings have been reported in Lhasa.\n\"This is a terrorist act, aimed at destroying peace in our area,\" he said. \"This was a brazen act.\"\nPolice had set up a special task force to search for the culprits and customs and immigration officials had stepped up security searches at Tibet's airport, he said.\nThe senior police official said the bomb was a home-made device made mainly from ammonium nitrate, a fertiliser.\n\"We are targeting Tibetan exiles returning from abroad and who have political connections,\" he said when asked about the focus of the manhunt.\n\"The bomb was made at a farm,\" he said. \"We are searching mainly in Lhasa, but are cooperating with other areas.\"\nChina regularly blames followers of Tibet's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama, for anti-Chinese unrest that erupts sporadically in the strategic Himalayan region that borders India.\nThe Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign to win autonomy for his homeland, says he wants self-government and freedom of worship in the deeply religious Buddhist region. He fled China in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Beijing rule.\nMonks in the devout Buddhist region who have spearheaded anti-Chinese demonstrations and riots in the past were not regarded as suspects, the police official said.\nOfficials have vowed to retaliate, signalling a possible renewed crackdown on anti-Chinese unrest in the region.\n\"We should wage a tit-for-tat struggle against the Dalai clique's sabotage,\" local radio quoted Gyamco, vice chairman of the regional government as saying last week.\nSeveral much smaller bombs have been been set off in Lhasa in the last two years, including one in 1995 that caused slight damage to a plaque donated by Beijing and another last March outside the headquarters of the Tibet regional government.",

But Russia, another major member-in-waiting, expected to win entry by the end of 1997, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Davydov said.",

The economy in this Himalayan region, still based largely on yaks, goats and Buddhism, also trails.\nBeijing says it is doing its utmost to narrow the gap and to make up for destruction wrought on Tibet's monasteries and temples in China's ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.\nIt has pumped more than 35 billion yuan (US$4.2 billion) into the inaccessible, remote and backward region long peopled by nomadic herders and barter traders, officials say.\nThe funds are also useful to buttress control of the restive and strategically important region that borders India.\nThe investment is slowly paying off.\nEconomic growth in 1995 reached 10.6 percent, up from 8.6 percent the year before. Rural per capita incomes were about 600 yuan ($72) a year while urban incomes neared 2,000 yuan ($240) -- both still about half the national average but increasing rapidly.\nIn the capital Lhasa, the swift growth of commerce has taken even local leaders by surprise.\n\"I thought it would take several years before we could attract any real interest,\" said Chen Ciduan, president of the Tibet Investment and Trust Corporation that in 1994 set up a stocks trading centre in Lhasa.\n\"But we had to double our space last year and we are already overcrowded and making plans for another expansion,\" he said.\nThat's the high flying end of economic development in Tibet.\nFor those at the other end of the scale, Beijing is trying to make things easier with preferential policies to help a people struggling into the late 20th century from a lifestyle that more closely resembles the middle ages.\nIncome tax holidays, tax breaks and easy loans are just some of the incentives available to businessman in Tibet. The concessions are also attracting numerous entrepreneurs from elsewhere in China where such favourable policies are not available.\nIn Lhasa, one street specialises in selling the highly-decorated, colourfully-painted furniture favoured by Tibetans. Another sells fake leather sofas that appeal to Han Chinese residents.\nChinese restaurants abound, cheek by jowl with Tibetan-managed shops selling yak butter, computer parts and bolts of brocade and wool.\nTibet offers some of China's oddest employment opportunities.\nIn a tiny one-room workshop leased from a struggling state-owned factory processing yak horns, seven artisans from neighbouring Yunnan province hammer traditional silver bowls embossed with Buddhist symbols.\n\"We were already making these Buddhist artifacts in Yunnan anyway,\" said workshop owner Li Wenhan, 26. \"It's only because there is so much demand here that we came. We could easily sell these in Yunnan, but here they need them.\"\nLi said 40 percent of the goods they make are for export, 20-30 percent are sold to Tibetans and the rest distributed elsewhere in China.\nThe success of Li's business underscores a problem in Tibet that must be as frustrating for its Chinese masters seeking to lead the region into prosperity as for many educated Tibetans.\n\"The Tibetans lack education and a mentality of work,\" said one Tibetan-Nepali businessman who was born in Lhasa.\n\"They don't appreciate the need to work, they just want to make a profit straight away,\" he said. \"It's very sad. They are too impatient to understand that you have to earn a living through steady work.\"\nWhile some might dispute that view, no one questions that Tibet is among China's poorest and most inaccessible regions. Out of Tibet's 2.3 million people, about 400,000 live below the official poverty line.\nOfficials oversee one of China's most innovative anti-poverty policies in the deeply devout Buddhist area where many still donate much of what they earn to monasteries and temples and where education is costly.\n\"We are determined to bring all Tibetans out of poverty by the end of the century,\" said an official who declined to be identified.\nAlmost all Tibetan government officials are involved in anti-poverty programmes. Each government department in the Tibet Autonomous Region sends officials into rural areas each year -- both to see where government money and aid are most needed and to teach poverty-stricken nomads how to boost their incomes.\nMany of Tibet's worst off are nomads living in remote mountain areas, many with large flocks of yaks, goats and sheep, but with little idea of how to exploit their resources.\nThe nomads either use their animals to feed themselves or, when their numbers climb, set them free as an offering to Buddha to try to win merit for their next reincarnation, believing that their station in each life is dependent on their behaviour in the previous one.\n\"Many of these people have assets but they are still poor because they don't know how to use them,\" the official said.\nTibet does not rely on handouts alone. Since last year it has worked at setting up sister relationships with 14 of China's booming eastern cities and provinces.\nThese wealthy cousins each send between 10 to 20 officials to work for three years in the region over a 10-year period and also provide financial resources.\nThe provinces are helping Tibet with 43 projects, mostly in infrastructure. Initial investment was 2.3 billion yuan ($277.1 million) but now totals more than 3.0 billion yuan ($361 million).\n\"Tibet's capacity to develop itself is very low,\" the official said. \"It's hampered by its geological conditions such as lack of infrastructure and its remoteness. And it takes a long time to move away from the previous feudal serf system.\n\"This is a very beautiful place but we have a very arduous task ahead.\"\n($1.0=8.3 yuan)",

        "Text": "Draft amendments to China's criminal law have sparked fierce debate among usually tame lawmakers, with controversy surrounding the scope of the death penalty and whether corrupt state managers should be executed.\nThe Workers Daily newspaper on Saturday published a rare insight into controversies troubling a string of amendments to the Criminal Law, currently under debate by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, or parliament, that meets behind closed doors.\n\"Looking at the last few days of debate by the standing committee of the draft criminal law amendments, argument on specific clauses has been very fierce,\" the newspaper said in an unusual expose of controversy in the usually rubber-stamp body.\nThe criminal law amendments along with a new anti-corruption law were two main items on the agenda of a week-long meeting of the standing committee that began on Tuesday to debate bills to be passed by the full annual session of parliament next March.\n\"Are there too many death penalties?\" was one of the top controversies this week, the Workers Daily said.\n\"Some people think that, with the international tide moving toward eliminating or reducing the use of the death penalty, even though the current amendments do not increase the number of death penalty clauses, however the current criminal law with more than 30 capital crimes should be reduced,\" it said.\nChina executes several thousand people each year and international human rights group Amnesty International recorded 3,612 death sentences and 2,535 executions in China in 1995 compared with 2,496 death sentences and 1,791 executions in 1994. Hundreds, if not thousands more, go unreported.\nFrom January 1, when a new criminal procedures law takes effect, China will add lethal injection as well as execution by firing squad as a new means of capital punishment.\nThe Workers Daily said another body of legislative opinion held that the death penalty should neither be reduced or eliminated because it served as a deterrent and answered a popular demand for harsher punishments to prevent crime.\nDebate also swirled around amendments to combat corruption, including more than 60 clauses that would specifically define graft and dereliction of duty, while increasing to 32 from seven the types of officials subject to the law, the newspaper said.\nHeated argument surrounded the designation of managers of state firms as government employees, who are subject to a maximum penalty of death for corruption, it said.\nOne body of opinion held that government factory managers be defined as public servants since 75 percent of all official cases of corruption involved state enterprise managers.\nOthers argued this was unfair since managers of non-state firms faced a maximum of only 15 years in jail for graft.\n\"On this issue, the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the Supreme People's Court hold very different opinions,\" the newspaper said.\nAll should be equal before the law, the newspaper quoted the criminal law as saying regarding the need to tackle corruption, which is regarded as the chief threat to Communist rule.\nIt made no mention of a former Beijing city party boss who was sacked in early 1995 after a vice-mayor committed suicide in a $37 million corruption scandal, but has yet to face charges.\nAnother source of contention among legislators was a proposal that police acting in the line of duty should bear no criminal responsibility for killing or injuring a suspect.\nThis proposal had won strong support from the Ministry of Public Security, especially after the deaths of 100 police in the first half of this year, it said.\n\"Those opposed believe that this regulation could be used as an excuse in cases when casualties result from improper use of weapons,\" the Workers Daily said.",

Divisova declined to say how much the state would buy for its reserves, nor what the reserves are, saying this was secret.\n\"State reserves will be filled, other parts will have to be exported. But it is very difficult to get to foreign markets,\" Divisova added.\nShe said Slovakia was not importing due to higher output. There are payment problems with Ukraine and Russia, but former Yugoslav countries were potentially interesting, she said.\nDirector of trading firm Agrointernational Petr Prochazka believed the surplus would total 50,000-80,000 tonnes, most of which would stay in the Czech Republic.\n\"The surplus will not be so dramatic...There are quite good yields but the harvest is going slowly due to bad weather. A forecast freeze and subsequent warming will limit output.\"\n\"Producers will not want to export...(because of low prices) Those who can store it, will, he told Reuters, adding he believed the state could buy up to 20,000 tonnes for reserves.\nSecretary of the Sugar Refiners' Association Vladimir Ulrich also saw a 50,000-80,000-tonne surplus but said it could be partially swallowed by the state and the elasticity of domestic consumption. But he stressed that financial costs of storing sugar could push producers to sell at any price.\nUlrich said local prices have dropped to 12-15 crowns per kilo from 16 earlier in the year. The market is protected by a 68.4 percent tariff, which will drop next year to 65 percent.\n\"We are pushed from two sides -- the domestic surplus and low price on the world market. If prices drop further, other sugar could get here,\" Ulrich told Reuters.\nBreweries could buy up to 10,000 tonnes more than they usually do if prices go below the costs of malt, and citric acid makers could take care of another 10,000 tonnes, Ulrich said.\n\"There is a hunger for sugar in Bulgaria, Romaina, Ukraine, also in Russia,\" said Ulrich. He added that Poland, which itself expects to have a sizeable surplus, was also a potential market.\n\"We also cannot expect to supply the London exchange, because our sugar does not meet the conditions,\" he noted.\nHe said Cezch exporters could also look to traditional markts like Saudi Arabia...\"Of course, the price would be poor.\"\nThe ministry and Ulrich said the surplus would lead to a smaller sown area next year after 104,115 hectares this year. \"I believe the optimal area for next few years would be between 90,000 and 94,000 hectares,\" Ulrich said.",

They also agreed to underwrite a rights issue to raise equity to between 1.74 and 2.5 billion crowns as a part of the deal.\nAero is pinning hopes of recovering from financial problems on its flagship L-159, a light training subsonic fighter currently in its final stages of development, which is to be equipped with Rockwell International Corp avionics.\nThe Czech army has signed up to buy 72 L-159s, and the government has already approved a 3.26 billion crown package clearing the heavily indebted company's books.\nOther criteria approved by the cabinet include that Aero will not pay out dividends until production of L-159 starts, and that the investor has to pay most of the price of the shares from his own assets, not on credit.",

The latest fire was put out several hours after it started.\nSoukup told Reuters that the current resumption of production at the refinery would continue as crude is diverted around the cracker.\nThe shutdown of the cracker would limit the content, not the amount, of processed crude, Soukup said.\n\"This (cracking) unit will be out of order for some time, and therefore the refinery will operate in a substitution regime.

The shares rose on the news.\nThe bank's net profit, calculated under international accounting standards, declined to 4.88 billion crowns from 5.44 billion, but Komercni shares moved higher on the Prague Stock Exchange as analysts praised the results.\nThe bank's finance division director Kamil Ziegler told a news conference that since third quarter 1995, Komercni had revised its accounting method to exclude unpaid late fees and commissions.\n\"Our profit, according to international accounting standards, is roughly 10 percent lower than in the same period of the last year. But there are very important methodological influences,\" Ziegler told reporters.\nOnly those fees that have actually been paid are included in the figures now whereas outstanding receivables were included previously, he said.\nHe added that the amount of late fees that would have been included under the previous accounting method was 1.2 billion crowns. Komercni posted a 5.11 billion net profit for the whole of 1995.\nThe bank's total assets rose to 432.04 billion crowns at the end of the third quarter from 336.21 billion, year-on-year.\nThe net interest margin declined to 4.07 percent from 5.40 percent, but up from 3.93 percent at the end of the first half.\nUnder Czech accounting standards, which Ziegler said do not include the tital of 700 million crowns of unrealised gains from securities, Komercni's gross profit for the period was 3.87 billion, down from 6.83 billion year on year.\nHe told rpeorters that he considered the results to be \"very good\", but warned that simple annualisation of the nine month figures would not lead to a full-year profit forecast.\nHe said fourth quarter results could be affected by unclear development on the stock market and other factors.\nSandy Winthrop Chen, vice president of equity research at the Prague office of CS First Boston, welcomed the figures,\n\"The results are quite in line with our expectations, I think the performance is very strong, and it puts Komercni Banka in a very good position to meet or exceed out 1996 forecast.\"\nHe added that the forecast was a 5.95 billion crown net profit, according to international standards.\nKomercni share price jumped 125 crowns on the Prague Stock Exchange soon after the news to 2,125, and closed at 2,126 after a week of heavy losses in which some analysts anticipated poor results.\nDealer Karel Ruzicka of ING Barings said the results were in line with his expectations and partly attributed Komercni's share price rise to demand from foreign investors.\n\"Some of the foreign investors...think they are not so bad therefore we can see some demand in the stock,\" he said.\nAdded Chen: \"We definitely remain buyers of the stock, and the recent weakeness in the shareprice we interpret as a major buyer opportunity.\"\nKomercni's largest shareholder is still the Czech government which has a 48.74 percent stake, followed by the Bank of New York which has accumlated a 9.65 percent stake.",

But the Central Election Commission said turnout in 53 of the 81 constituencies had been just 34.27 percent.\nThis was far lower than forecast and compared with 76.4 percent participation in lower house elections held in June.\nKlaus, the father of Czech economic reform, played down the voter apathy and played up the ODS performance following his electoral disaster last June, when strong Social Democrat gains stripped his three-party coalition of its lower house majority.\n\"From the results so far it is obvious that the citizens of this country understand that they want stability,\" he told reporters, alluding to the political stalemate which has stalled reform since the inconclusive lower house polls.\n\"These elections ... are an important test of the political feelings of people of this country about the (June) elections. In this respect they are giving an important signal,\" he said.\nUnder the Senate rules, candidates who fail to win over half the first round vote have to face the runner-up in a second round. Most constituencies will be decided next weekend.\nBut already it appears the Social Democrats of economist Milos Zeman have done badly, failing to come out on top in a single constituency.\nZeman, whose party has been afflicted by squabbling, appeared to blame the low turnout for the poor result.\nBut he added: \"I firmly believe that in the second round, participation will be markedly higher because then it is a choice between the two strongest candidates.\"\nIn the end the Republicans led by doctor of philosophy Miroslav Sladek came out looking best without even running.\nSladek hit a chord by denouncing the Senate as a waste of time and money. \"They had nowhere to dump the political zombies so they established the Senate,\" he told a recent rally.\nPolls showed few Czechs understand the function of the Senate, which has little power compared with the lower Chamber of Deputies. With a few exceptions, most of the candidates are little known because Czech leaders all sit in the lower house.\nConventional wisdom has been that if ODS did well in the Senate, Klaus might provoke early lower house polls to regain the coalition's majority, although he denies that.\nBut ODS is better at mobilising support than the Social Democrats when interest is low. A big ODS win on a low turnout might therefore not be representative for lower house polls.\n\"If there is a low turnout, even if Klaus wins, I think that it would be very difficult for the ODS to know the real mood of the country,\" said Jiri Pehe, research director at the Open Media Research Institute (OMRI).",

        "Text": "Bitter infighting broke out among Czech Social Democrats on Friday only a month before elections in which the opposition party hopes to humiliate conservative Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.\nParty chairman Milos Zeman denied there was any split in his party, which is running neck and neck with Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) before Senate elections next month.\nBut almost in the same breath he threatened to resign next spring unless a party deputy chairman who broke ranks to vote with the Klaus government last week went first.\nAdding to his woes, a Social Democrat deputy threatened to leave the parliamentary party in a row with an ex-communist colleague, a move which could tip the balance of parliamentary power between the minority government and opposition.\nKlaus, whose three-party coalition lost its parliamentary majority in lower house elections earlier this year, has seemed under heavy pressure with opinion polls showing the Social Democrats level or slightly ahead of his ODS.\nBut just as the Social Democrats seemed in with a good chance of beating the ODS for the first time since the restoration of democracy, strife flared in opposition ranks.\nLast week Jozef Wagner, the chairman of the parliamentary budget committee, led a revolt by four Social Democrat deputies which allowed the 1997 state budget to pass its first reading.\nTempers flared on Friday after Wagner threatened to resign from the parliamentary party unless another Social Democrat deputy, ex-communist Michal Kraus, quit the budget committee and a parliamentary commission investigating a bank collapse.\nDespite the appearance of disarray in Social Democrat ranks, Zeman played down Wagner's threat. \"There is no real split. I do not want to overestimate the importance of his proclamation in this case,\" he told a news conference.\n\"A split would happen only if a body of opinion formed which was sharply different in questions of principle from the opinion of the party leadership,\" he said.\nBut then he attacked party deputy chairman Karel Machovec, one of the Wagner rebels. \"There should not be a person in the leadership who shows himself up by talking about disputes in the party,\" said Zeman.\nAsked if he would resign if Machovec remained vice chairman after a party congress scheduled for next March, Zeman said: \"Yes. It is true, I can confirm that.\"\nKraus, a communist deputy before the 1989 collapse of the East Bloc, accused the four budget rebels of being \"corrupted politically\" by the Klaus coalition.\nWagner told the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes he would leave the Social Democratic parliamentary party or \"club\" if Kraus did not go. Machovec was quoted by local media as saying that if Wagner left, there would be a serious party split.\nThis could change the balance of power in the 200-seat lower house where the Social Democrats, along with the little-reformed Communists and the far-right Republicans, have 101 votes to the government's 99.\nThe Senate itself has few powers. But the elections on November 15 and 16, with a second round runoff a week later, have become a test of public opinion which could indicate whether early lower house elections are likely.\nAnalysts say that if the Social Democrats perform strongly, Zeman might be tempted to bring down the coalition to force lower house polls in which his party might overtake Klaus's ODS. But that depends on Zeman being able to maintain discipline.\nSo far voters do not seem concerned. A poll taken by the STEM agency before and after the budget vote showed the Social Democrats with 27.3 percent support ahead of ODS with 26.8.\nIn the lower house elections on May 31-June 1, ODS won 29.6 percent and the Social Democrats 26.4.",

This compared with 36.5 percent for the ODS, led by conservative Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.\nWhile the ODS called a news conference on Monday to trumpet its dominant showing, leading Social Democrats went to ground after a weekend of squabbling over who was to blame.\nVasil Biben, Social Democrat candidate in the north Bohemian town of Trutnov, was blunt in his criticism of Zeman.\n\"The Social Democrats were were hurt by his pre-election excesses, thanks to which the party lost centre-left voters,\" the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted Biben, who will fight a second round run-off this weekend, as saying.\nShortly before the polls Zeman alleged secret agents had tried to extract compromising information from his elderly mother.\nEarlier he had caused uproar when he accused the state intelligence agency BIS of spying on him. But he failed to provide evidence to a parliamentary watchdog and earned a rebuke from President Vaclav Havel.\nThe Social Democrats divided roughly into those who back Zeman and those who support four rebel deputies who voted with Klaus's coalition in a parliamentary budget vote last month.\nLow turnout also hit the centre-left party, which did so well in general parliamentary six months ago that Klaus's centre-right coalition lost its parliamentary majority.\nOnly 34 percent of the electorate bothered to vote for the newly-created Senate (upper house), which few Czechs seem to understand. But the pro-business ODS proved much better at getting its supporters out than the opposition.\nThe Social Democrats failed to win most votes in any constituency, although their candidates went through to the second round in 48 of the 81 constituencies by finishing second.\nAfterwards Zeman blamed the rebels, who included one of his vice-chairmen, Karel Machovec, for the setback. The defection in early October triggered public squabbling between the party's right wing and former communist colleagues.\nZeman dismissed the row over the BIS as a factor, citing a poll taken before the spy scandal broke which showed a sharp drop in the willingness of Czechs to vote again so soon after general elections.\n\"When I analyse what happened, and see that this opinion poll preceded the BIS affair, then I can find only one cause and that is the budget vote,\" he said.\nOne Social democrat rebel, Jozef Wagner, described this as nonsense.\nWagner, who chairs the parliamentary budget committee, noted that the BIS affair had been broken not by Zeman but by Deputy Prime Minister Josef Lux, who leads the Christian Democrats, a junior partner in Klaus's coalition.\nWagner said the Social Democrats should have stayed quiet in the affair, which cost the job of the BIS acting director.",

        "Text": "Air Hong Kong Ltd (AHK) chief operating officer, Stanley Hui said the August 25 start of its first trans-Pacific service means the airline is now firmly headed in the right direction.\nThe head of Hong Kong's only all-cargo airline told Reuters in an interview said it was \"an important milestone towards a much brighter future.\"\nHowever Hui said the cargo carrier did not make any money in the first half of 1996 suffering, like many others, from low yields.\nLast year AHK made its first ever profit and although Hui would not disclose the exact amount, he said it was \"very healthy\" after \"huge losses\" in the past.\nFour years ago, things were so bad that the airline was just a telephone call away from going under, industry sources said.\nBut then a new management team was installed, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd came to the rescue by taking a 75 percent stake, loss-making routes were cut, old aircraft were retired and three newly converted Boeing 747-200s acquired, Hui added.\nThe new aircraft are able to carry 25 tons more tonnes than the carrier's old aircraft and complete with a new Chinese wheel company logo signifying brisk business, they began a twice weekly service to Chicago on August 25.\nWhen Air Hong Kong's third converted 747 leased from Cathay Pacific for 15 years joins the fleet in October, the Chicago service will become three times weekly.\nHui says the new route has been possible with the leasing of the three former combi 747s which formerly flew with the Brazilian airline Varig.\nThe aircraft, converted at Boeing facilities in Wichita, Kansas and at Hong Kong Aero Engine Services Ltd, will give AHK a much higher aircraft utilisation rate from 12 to 14 hours per day.\nAHK existing fleet of older 747s are being returned to the leasing company.\n\"We're talking about more expensive aeroplanes but they're more reliable, with better payload and can help save on maintenance so it's a good investment for this company.\"Hui said.\nCathay Pacific has handed its once weekly Chicago service over to AHK in order to concentrate on its own new twice weekly freighter service to New York which also started on August 24.\nThe new U.S. services have been made possible after a new air agreement was drawn up between the U.S. and Hong Kong government.\nAHK also fly to Dubai, Brussels and Manchester five times a week and twice weekly to Osaka. It has applied for a twice weekly service to Seoul in South Korea on Friday.\nHui said there has been a 20 per cent drop in cargo selling rates over the past six months.\n\"But I'm not surprised, the market is very competive, very seasonal and slow in the first half. We have seen a slower market this year consequently rates have dropped, tonnage is down, rates and yields are down but I think we are seeing a nice recovery. Developing for us and Chicago will help that. It is a very important gateway for us,\" Hui said.",

        "Text": "All three airlines flying directly between Hong Kong and London said they can start to use a new, short cut to Europe across China from this weekend with the start of winter timetables on Sunbday October 27.\nThis means more cargo and less fuel can be carried along with a cut in passenger journey times of up to an hour, industry sources said.\nCathay Pacific Airways, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic all say they can begin to utilise the new northern route over China instead of the traditional longer southerly route over Thailand and India in their winter schedules. The short cut was agreed during recent talks between the British and Chinese governments, they say.\nA Cathay Pacific spokesman said up to an hour can be cut off the flying time for its Boeing 747-400 aircraft on some European routes which will also have the ability to carry an additional four tonnes of cargo. BA can carry an extra 70 tonnes of air cargo a week if its twice weekly 747-400 aircraft utilise the new routing, its Hong Kong based spokesman said.\nA spokesman for Virgin Atlantic said the new routing will enable its Airbus A340 aircraft to carry an extra six tonnes of freight westbound and two tonnes eastbound and save around 50,000 pounds of fuel.\nAviation analysts say the new routing offers significant cost saving advantages and allows airlines to carry full cargo loads all year round because strong headwinds during the summer restricts cargo payload.\nBut they say it is not all good news because the airlines haven't been granted permission for all flights.\n\"It is fantastic news for the airlines and very influential on the bottom line but realistically Cathay can't utilise the new routes on all flights because it has not been given a full quota and neither have the others,\" Peter Negline, Vice President and senior research analyst of Asia Pacific equity research at Salomon Brothers Hong Kong Limited told Reuters in an interview.\nA Cathay Pacific spokesman said it will have the most access to the number of flights that can use the new routing. Other European services to Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt will also be able to benefit as well as London bound ones, he added.\nCurfews at both Heathrow and Kai Tak airports will also cause scheduling difficulties until Hong Kong's new, around the clock airport at Chek Lap Kok is due to open in 18 months time, analysts say.\n\"Aircraft need to leave Hong Kong before the 11.30 pm local (16.30 GMT) curfew starts but the new routing could mean arrival at Heathrow at round 04.30 GMT which is two hours before the end of their curfew so the new routing doesn't offer a lot there,\"Negline said.\n\"You can also see a further deterioration in cargo yields because the airlines are getting extra capacity for next to nothing,\" Negline added.\nNegline said the airlines will also benefit from better aircraft and crew utilisation; the aircraft will be able to fly extra sectors and its crew who fly for less hours can be redeployed on other services.\nDeclan Magee, a Hong Kong based airline analyst for regional stockbrokers and investment bankers HG Asia also said the new routing will obviously benefit aircraft utilisation and fuel efficiency.\n\"Yes shorter routes will save money but if all three airlines are allowed to do the same thing that rules out competitive advantage. If only one airline could use the new route then it would be different but the consumer will feel the benefit.\nMagee said the Hong Kong to London route is Cathay's fourth largest passenger revenue generating route of around HK$1.4 billion a year.\n\"It is a relatively important route but even if they can save four or five per cent on this route compared to Cathay's total turnover of around HK$30 billion a year.it's not that much. Yes, it's a useful way in which Cathay can offset some of the negatives it is facing in terms of yield decline,\" Magee said.\nAnalysts reckon the airlines can save around 10 tons of fuel per flight but that may be offset by expected higher overfly fees set by the Chinese who are aware of how much the airlines can save.\nAnalysts say the airlines need all the help they can get by utilising shorter routes and using new technology such as FANS - Future Air Navigation System which allows aircraft more direct routing. Because of successful negotiations earlier, Swissair and Lufthansa have been able to fly the shorter route over China to Europe for the past two years. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542-7706 Fax+44 171 542-5017",

It should save the trouble of trucking cargo down from Guangzhou to Hong Kong and we are investigating opening an office there,\" Fong said.\nIndustry observers said Guangzhou-based China Southern has invested in a new fleet of Boeing 777 aircraft to begin transcontinental services to Europe and the west coast of the USA and U-Freight is among a group of many well known freight forwarders who are eyeing the potential new market. Recent Hong Kong press reports said China Southern is starting a Guangzhou-Beijing-Amsterdam service next month and planning additional services to Los Angeles and Brisbane next year. No one at China Southern could be contacted for confirmation.\n\"We are just awaiting a start date for China Southern's new trans-Pacific flight,\" Fong told Reuters in an interview here.\nFong said the licensing procedure to start operations, especially to gain a Class one licence which allows freight forwarders to hold a stock of airway bills, will take time and patience.\n\"A proper licence in Shanghai took three years to achieve so it is early days yet but we would like to go into Guangzhou and a first step would be to set up a liaison office in the near future,\" Fong added. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017",

Known as the Beluga because of its giant, whale like appearance and cavernous 7.4 metre high jaw-like door, it is one of the world's most unusual aircraft which Airbus said can carry more voluminous freight than any other.\nThe first two of an eventual fleet of four aircraft are being used to transport large sections of fuselage and the wings for the Airbus family which are made near Chester, England and are flown to Toulouse for assembly. Other fuselage sections weighing up to 45 tons and 30 metres long are transported from Spain and Germany.\nWhen the aircraft are not busy doing that, Airbus says it hope it can profit from wet leases of other outsize cargoes such as helicopters, aircraft engines and space satellites in which field China is a key world player with its Long March launcher.\n\"No other aircraft in the world can carry such large and unusual loads. The thing about satellites is they need to be transported whole and cannot be broken down for transport. It is a niche market but one we think there are opportunities in,\" Velupillai said.\nAirbus said its large transporter has already been used to carry a satellite module which will form part of space station Alpha from Turin in Italy to Toulouse . Other projects include ferrying aviator Richard Branson's balloon to Morocco for his aborted round the world attempt.\nThe Beluga made its air show debut at Paris last year but is not being exhibited in China.\nThe twin engined purpose-built jets replace veteran four propellor engined Super Guppy aircraft which Airbus said are destined to become museum pieces. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017",

Barclays is also expected to continue repurchases on which it has already spent around one billion pounds.\nLloyds TSB could also eventually join the share buy-back club as its capital ratios improve, though most analysts do not see this happening before 1998.\nSalomon Brothers banking analyst John Leonard said he expects the British economic outlook to remain favourable.\nThe strength of sterling, while affecting those banks that report dollar income in sterling, looks set to keep the lid on inflation and interest rates, a scenario the banks should be able to deal with.\nIf rates were to rise more than expected then that could be a problem for bank share prices if the market thought bad debt provisions were set to rise.\nOn the other hand, many analysts are not convinced by the link between interest rates and bank share prices.\n\"It's sometimes dificult to tell what causes prices to fall from the outside,\" said one analyst who declined to be named. \"Bank shares have done very well in recent years and operators may well take profits on any (market) setback to lock them away. But that doesn't mean they have changed their view.\"\nOn domestic banking, analysts are happy that banks have been moving more into higher-margin personal sector borrowing at the expense of the lower margins seen in the corporate sector.\nBut they are less happy about the competitive mortgage market which, despite an upturn, is hardly setting the world alight.\nWhile bad debts remain stable, net bad debt charges could rise as releases of old provisions work their way out of the system.\nOther share markets could also have an influence, analysts say.\nSome investors compare the British and U.S. bank sectors and last year, the U.S. rather lost out. If this were to turn, then the British banks could come under some pressure, said Salomon's Leonard.\nBut analysts are already a little nervous given that the banks' good run has continued with such strength.\n\"Some stocks are definitely looking less compelling given the rush of blood we've seen in the New Year,\" said one.",

Of these, there is an overlap 700,000, which means that the Society is sending out a total of around 8.0 million voting packs.\nInvesting members will also get a variable share allocation depending on how much money they had in their accounts on particular dates.

The society has started a huge advertising campaign to encourage members to vote.\nThe Halifax is expected to be in the top 20 companies by market capitalisation in the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip firms and is sure to threaten Abbey's position as Britain's fifth-largest publicly-owned bank.\nIt said it sees room for huge expansion in the British insurance and long-term savings sectors.",

Those departing also include seven foreign exchange traders, metals traders, secretaries and telephonists.\nIn an internal memo, Bob Diamond, who has been Global Markets chief since July, said von Ungern-Sternberg had decided to leave after the new structure was put in place as his role \"was substantially narrower.\"\nSince Bill Harrison joined BZW as chief executive from Robert Fleming there have been the usual personnel changes associated with the investment banking business.\nThere was no room, for example, for Barclays veteran Donald Brydon who had been running BZW after its previous head, David Band, died earlier in the year.\nHarrison and Diamond are thought to be working on methods to make profitability more sustainable -- a quandary which is at the centre of the debate on the investment banking industry.\nThe industry's detractors, among them Lloyds TSB chief Brian Pitman, always point to the fact that the revenue stream cannot be relied upon as it is subject to market volatility.\nIn the good times, when markets are booming and mergers and acquisitions on a roll, investment banks rake in profits as if there is no tomorrow and the participants get paid huge bonuses.\nBut in the bad times, the banks can rack up heavy losses in markets which suddenly look very over-populated.\nDiamond, in common with the head of the Barclays group, chief executive Martin Taylor, is known to want to intensify the return on capital employed in the business.\nHe knows that unless BZW's profits are sustained at high levels, he will find it difficult to put together the kind of team needed to succeed in an increasingly competitive and crowded environment.\nNo aspect of BZW's markets business from gilts to JGBs (Japanese government bond) and dollar/yen to copper will be left out of the in-depth review, banking sources added.\nIn the meantime BZW, along with other banks, will also continue to react to more short-term events in the markets.\nFor example the departure of foreign exchange traders follows a period of reduced volatility in the market over the last few months.\nIronically, such periods of volatility are key to both outperformance and underperformance which dictate returns on capital for investment banks.",

But if they want to play the takeover game then they will have to play by the same rules as everyone else.\"\nThe Building Societies Association welcomed the revised Bill and encouraged its early introduction to Parliament.\nBSA chairman Brian Davis, who is also chief executive of the Nationwide Building Society that is not planning to convert, said the BSA fully supported the Treasury's \"thoughtful compromise\" on the question of takeover protection.\nUnder current company law, 10 percent of shareholders can call a special general meeting of the company and this will not change for converting societies. But any proposal to waive its five-year immunity to takeover will have to be approved by 75 percent of the voting shareholders.\nSome societies had criticised the Treasury's proposals because they did not allow friendly takeovers, such as between one large society and a local smaller one.\n\"We came to the conclusion that the distinction between friendly and hostile takeovers was too difficult to define and that it would have been unworkable,\" the Treasury said.",

        "Text": "Three of Britain's largest bulding societies, which plan stock market flotations in 1997, on Thursday said draft legislation relating to protection from takeovers had forced them to examine their float plans closely.\nThe mutually-owned societies, who specialise in mortgage lending, the Woolwich, Alliance & Leicester and the Northern Rock, all plan to convert to bank status next year and have combined assets of around 70 billion pounds ($117 billion).\nBut a change in the draft of a new Building Societies Act has thrown their plans into confusion as the government proposes to change the way converted societies will be treated in the crucial area of takeover bids.\nThe issue is most pressing for the Alliance & Leicester as it seems highly unlikely that the new draft will be ready before Alliance members meet on December 10 to vote on conversion.\nPreviously, converting societies were protected by a rule which protected them from takeover for five years after flotation, allowing them to make the transition successfully.\nUntil now, the only one to have gone through the process is the Abbey National, which converted to a bank in 1989.\nDraft legislation is now under consideration although it is doubtful whether there will time for it to become law before next year's general election.\nThe draft proposes that societies lose their immunity from takeover if they merge with another \"financial institution\" (after flotation) even on an agreed basis.\nA Treasury spokeswoman said this did not include the buying of mortgage portfolios from other financial institutions.\nThe Treasury argues that converting societies should play by the market rules and that the focus of the bill is on those societies who want to remain mutual.\n\"The loss of the five year protection if any acquisition is undertaken - not just a hostile bid - seems a little unfair,\" Adam Applegarth, director of Northern Rock told Reuters.\nThe Teasury said it was considering representations to retain immunity in the case of friendly mergers where a large society might merge with a small local institution.\nApplegarth said the Northern Rock and other societies were also very concerned at another proposed clause which would allow shareholders of the new company to waive the five year protection, saying this could allow takeovers by the backdoor.\nHe said a predator might be able to buy up 10 percent of the stock of the company and announce a bid at the same time, calling an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders which would be asked to waive the protection, bypassing the board.\nThe societies all said the uncertainty was the biggest problem at the moment -- what the bill will say and also when it will be published and whether it will have time to be passed.\n\"We think that if there is little chance that the bill will be passed, it would be better not to publish it at all, frankly,\" said Applegarth.\nThe societies have a duty to inform members of all possible relevant information so they can make an informed decision.\nThe Treasury said it hoped to publish its revised proposals next month regardless of whether the bill is likely to pass into law before the election which must be held by May 1997.\nA Woolwich spokeswoman said there was no more than a possibility that the draft bill would delay its float. \"If the rules are changed, then the board would have a duty to reconsider,\" she said.\nThe other societies took a similar view, but the Alliance & Leicester has a particular problem as its members have already been voting on the change by post.\n\"At the moment we are steaming ahead, we are on schedule,\" a spokesman for the Alliance said. But he agreed that timing could be affected and confirmed that the Alliance board would discuss the problem at a meeting on Thursday.\nThe Northern Rock plans to issue its transfer document, to members in early March of next year, but it must be printed in February, leaving little time for the government to produce the finished version of the proposed law ahead of this.",

Deloitte & Touche said it was making a payment of $2.65 billion, equal to 24.5 percent of their claims.\nBCCI had assets of $24 billion and operations in 71 countries at the time of the collapse.",

It is the best growth stock...it's very much in demand. That's why we are concentrating on doing as much development as we can,\" Hunt added.\nThe group was also buying investments in the \"second-hand\" market. \"We are pursuing both avenues,\" he said, pointing out that Land Securities had recently added the Team Valley Retail Park, south of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, to its portfolio.\nThis would make \"a substantial and valuable addition to our 500 million pound retail warehouse portfolio,\" he said in his chairman's statement.\nDuring the half year the company had bought, or agreed to buy, nearly 80 million pounds of investment properties.\nHunt said he did not think there would be a less favourable environment for the group if Britiain's opposition Labour party won power from the ruling Conservative government at the next general election, due to be held by May 1997.\n\"I believe the strategies we are pursuing will apply equally within a New Labour environment as in a Conservative (one).\"\nHunt said that while he could not comment on possible acquisition targets, the firm looked at \"everything from time to time\" but would have to \"want to own quite a high proportion of the properties\" of any target company before making a bid.",

But if they want to play the takeover game then they will have to play by the same rules as everyone else.\"\nThe Woolwich, which has assets of just under 30 billion pounds ($49.97 billion) and plans to float next July, said it was disappointed the government has not taken into account its \"serious concerns\" on the timing of the draft.\n\"Had our board known when it took the decision to convert that this (change in the law) was even a possibility, then we might have chosen to convert in a different way,\" a spokeswoman for the Woolwich said.\nIf the bill was enacted, she said the Woolwich board would have a duty to revisit its conversion plans.\nIn contrast the Northern Rock, also planning a flotation in 1997, welcomed the changes.\n\"We are delighted with it,\" said Adam Applegarth, a director of the Northern Rock. \"It's a prefectly reasonable compromise and you cant ask for more than that.\"\nThe Building Societies Association also welcomed the revised Bill and encouraged its early introduction to Parliament.\nBSA chairman Brian Davis, who is also chief executive of the Nationwide Building Society that is not planning to convert, said the BSA fully supported the Treasury's \"thoughtful compromise\" on the question of takeover protection.\nUnder current company law, 10 percent of shareholders can call a special general meeting of the company and this will not change for converting societies. But any proposal to waive its five-year immunity to takeover will have to be approved by 75 percent of the voting shareholders.\nSome societies had criticised the Treasury's proposals because they did not allow friendly takeovers, such as between one large society and a local smaller one.\n\"We came to the conclusion that the distinction between friendly and hostile takeovers was too difficult to define and that it would have been unworkable,\" the Treasury said.\nThe Halifax, the country's biggest home lender has already waived its right to takeover protection by transferring its business to an existing subsidiary.",

They all said they would co-operate fully if they were approached.\nThe investigation is another chapter in a troubled corporate story littered with incidents, which earlier this year saw two firms -- Salomon Brothers and Swiss Bank Corp (SBC) -- cleared of insider trading.\nThe two had been among underwriters of a Eurotunnel rights issue in 1994 and, although never named by Paris stock exchange watchdog the Commission de Operations de Bourse (COB), said that they were under investigation in July last year.\nThe underwriting group also included Banque Indosuez, Morgan Grenfell, now owned by Deutsche Bank AG, Societe de Banque, Banque Nationale de Paris, Banque Paribas, Caisse des Depots, Crdit Agricole, Credit Lyonnais, Robert Fleming, S.G. Warburg (now part of SBC) and Belgian utility Tractebel SA.\nAbout two thirds of Eurotunnel shares are held in France and, as a general rule, more trading in the shares goes on in Paris than in London.\nThe SFO's usual practise is to issue notices which require a person or institution to be interviewed or hand over documents, although it can also apply for a search warrant if it wants to surprise its target.\nOn Monday, it remained unclear what period is currently under investigation.\nThe COB has already investigated the period surrounding the rights issue, though it could be revisiting this highly volatile time.\nThere have been persistent suggestions that some operators were short-selling at around the time of the rights issue -- forcing the prices down by selling shares they do not own in the hope of buying them back more cheaply later.\nEurotunnel has called on stock exchange authorities on both sides of the Channel to investigate volatile dealings at various times over the years.\nAnother example was in Agust 1995, when a rogue report that the company had signed a debt rescheduling agreement sent the stock reeling.\nThe Anglo-French tunnel operator at that time denied it had signed a debt agreement and demanded an inquiry into the trading activity and erroneous reports surrounding its shares and the incident might well be the focus of the French probe.",

This was extended to the 24 \"instructing banks\" at a meeting late last week in London.\nEurotunnel said the debt-for-equity swap would be at 130 pence, or 10.40 francs, per share. That is considerably below the level of around 160 pence widely reported in the run up to the deal, and will reduce outstanding debt of 8.7 billion pounds by 1.0 billion.\nThe company said a further 3.7 billion pounds of debt would be converted into new financial instruments and existing shareholders would be able to participate in this issue.\nIf they choose not to take up free warrants entitling them to subscribe to this, Eurotunnel said shareholders' interests may be reduced further to just over 39 percent of the company by the end of December 2003.",

They were, in most cases in my opinion, those who did not come with the intention to rob the money and disappear or something like that, I don't say that,\" Salzmann contended.\n\"But many of them founded the bank with false ideas that (their) bank would be able to provide themselves with easier conditions and lower prices for money for their internal use.\"\nSalzmann said these bad lending practices spiraled until the banks were forced to raise their rates and tighten lending conditions for regular customers.\n\"This snowballed from the naivete at the beginning,\" he said.\nKreditni suffered losses reportedly at more than 10 billion Czech crowns ($381.1 million) through a series of large loan defaults and on August 8 the central bank withdrew its banking licence.\nThe local press has been ripe with allegations of mismanagement and murky loan operations at many of the failed institutions, but criminal investigations have yet to produce any charges.\nOfficials from Kreditni Banka have refused to comment on reasons for its failure, but its controlling shareholder, the large insurer Ceska Pojistovna, chalked it up simply to bad decisions by bank management on loans and loan guarantees.\nSalzmann, 67, said problems in the banking system were part of a bigger problem of honesty and fairness throughout the economy.\nHe said that if elected, he would push to expand the enforcement power of regulators to police dubious practices in banks, investment funds, and on the capital market, which is consistently hampered by charges of insider trading.\nBANKER SEEKS POLITICAL PLATFORM\n\"My (candidacy), is to bring to this freshly-introduced capitalism more decency...a better field for good business,\" said Salzmann.\nThe erudite banker, who often recalls the days of thriving Czech capitalism between wars, said he would work in the Senate to establish an independent capital market watchdog like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSalzmann resigned as the chairman of the Prague Stock Exchange earlier this year -- a mostly honorary position -- to allow his friend and party colleague Tomas Jezek to take over as a full-time, hands-on leader of the bourse.\nBoth Jezek and Salzmann will run for the Senate in separate constituencies, and both support starting up a market-supported watchdog beefed up from the currently understaffed and underfunded Finance Ministry regulation department.\nBut Salzmann, who said he cannot by contract retire from the bank for at least one more year, rejects charges that his membership in the Senate while heading the country's largest banking group would constitute a conflict of interest. There is no legal requirement in the Czech Republic for legislators to suspend their business interests when they enter parliament.\nSalzmann insists he would never use his Senate seat to gain advantages for his bank, but he makes no apologies about using his seat to try to improve the banking and business environment overall.\n\"I will support all such measures to bring more fairness, decency, good manners, transparency, all those principals which are, of course, favourable for the banks. So in that sense I will be perhaps in a conflict of interest,\" Salzmann said.\nWhen asked if that meant he would support laws which would separate the banks and their investment arms, many of which control major chunks of the Czech economy -- like at Komercni Banka -- Salzmann answered:",

That is why the projects, wherever appropriate, should work mainly for the benefit of the victims of National-Socialist violence.\"\nDiplomats said privately that the signing ceremony might take place somewhere outside Prague, but Czech officials said last week it would not take place in those areas which Germany annexed in 1938, known as the Sudetenland.\nPrague is not part of the area Germany considered as the Sudetenland.\nGerman Chancellor Helmut Kohl is expected to visit the Czech Republic, probably on January 21 and 22, to sign the text with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.\nIn early February Czech President Vaclav Havel and German President Roman Herzog are expected to address the parliaments of each other's countries in ceremonies giving final approval to the declaration.",

You can't definitely tell,\" Pafko told reporters.\nBut to many Czechs, the cause was clear:\n\"It has to be the smoking,\" was the oft-repeated phrase of workers in central Prague, many of them smokers.\n\"Stopping now won't help anyway. I was smoking before you were born,\" said Karel, 43, a maintenence man puffing away over beer in one of the hundreds of Prague's smoke-blanketed pubs.\nDr. Pavko said Havel smoked one last pre-surgery cigarette with Jan Strasky, a chain smoker who happens also to be minister of health, whose warning on smoking's link to cancer is on every legally-sold pack of cigarettes in the country.\nHavel, as many Czechs, came of age smoking heavy Communist cigarettes, and has moved to more expensive western brands.\nA country of 10 million people smokes 23 billion cigarettes each year. Consumption has grown from five cigarettes per day to more than six averaged out for every man, woman, and child.\nAmid an influx of western brands -- U.S. Philip Morris bought a controlling stake in the former monopoly state tobacco packager, and has made Marlboro a status symbol -- Havel vetoed measures to regulate public smoking and cigarette advertising.\nThe president once also was blamed for a nuclear alert by lighting up while touring a power plant, but an official re-enactment of the incident declared it was photographers' flashes, not Havel's smoke, which set off the alarm.",

If this carries on into 1998 and 1999 there are going to be big worries.\"\nHe expected that, despite the poor trade results, the Czech crown should be able to stay within the central bank's band of plus/minus 7.5 percent from the mid-point of the mark/dollar basket to which it is fixed each day.\nAfter the CSU announcement, the crown remained steady, trading in a tight range around the central bank's Friday fixing at 26.960 to the dollar and 17.739 to the mark, or 2.75 percent above parity with the basket.\nThe CSU slightly eased its forecast for full-year 1996 inflation to 8.9 percent from 9.0 percent in August, and said consumer prices would slow to between 7.5 percent to 8.0 percent for the whole of next year.\nIt said unemployment would remain at one of the lowest levels in Europe, but said it would edge up slightly to between 3.3 to 3.5 percent by the end of 1997 from 3.3 percent at the end of this year.\nThe slowdown of inflation -- to an average of 7.5 to 8.0 percent by the end of 1997 from 8.9 percent at the end of 1996 -- would be helped by a slowing in real wage growth to between 8.1 to 8.5 percent next year from 9.1 percent in 1996, the CSU said.",

        "Text": "As Czech leaders finally get around to discuss a worrying surge in the trade deficit, analysts suggest a mixed bag of macro and micro-economic fixes, but most say devaluing the crown should be avoided.\nSome say the deficit is a necessary product of economic reform and will turn around next year, while the gap between growth in imports, up a nominal 15.2 percent in January-August year-on-year, and exports, up 6.4 percent, will close.\nPrime Minister Vaclav Klaus, who for months said there was nothing to worry about as the deficit soared, finally bowed to pressure and called a meeting for Tuesday to confront the gap.\nBut the meeting was abruptly postponed on Monday with cabinet officials citing the rising pressure of October's parliament session as a reason. A new date for the meeting has yet to be set, but officials say it will be \"soon\".\nThe trade deficit grew to a record 100 billion crowns ($3.68 billion) from January-August, the same as for the whole of 1995, and the markets are anxiously awaiting to see what, if anything, might be done.\nForecasts say that the current account deficit will also grow to around six percent of gross domestic product in 1996 from four percent last year.\nWhen Klaus and three cabinet members, plus central bank Governor Josef Tosovsky and Czech Statistical Bureau chairman Edvard Outrata, finally discuss possible fixes for the rapidly expanding gap, they will have heard plenty of advice.\nMany analysts say capital inflows can finance the deficit in the short term and urge moves, other than devaluation, that would gradually improve the competitiveness of Czech exporters.\nOthers suggest measures that could bring immediate relief, including import charges and fiscal adjustment.\nGOVERNMENT SHOULD AIM FOR BUDGET SURPLUS NEXT YEAR\n\"The reaction should come immediately, before the deficit becomes unmanageable,\" said Vladimir Kreidl, economist at Prague's Patria Finance.\nKlaus's government should not only pass its fifth straight balanced budget, but fight for a 1997 surplus of one or two percent of GDP. Other fiscal restrictions could be imposed to help cut domestic demand for imports, he said.\n\"Fiscal restriction is the most effective tool for reducing the deficit,\" Kreidl said, adding that the government should back private savings and a fully-funded pension system.\nSTRUCTURAL REFORMS NEEDED TO BOOST COMPETITIVENESS\nKreidl said more attention was needed to improve the capital markets which would strengthen currency inflow. Speeding up privatisation by sell-offs to strategic foreign investors would also boost competitiveness, he said.\n\"Czech exporters must become more cost competitive,\" said Jiri Huebner, Czech and Slovak team director for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).\n\"There is a need for substantial investments in new plant and technology...to improve productivity.\"\nThe government has contended that many of the imports which are fuelling the deficit are modernising Czech industry, which should eventually produce higher export output, but Huebner said more targeted policies were necessary.\nHe advocated an acceleration of depreciation on new capital expenditures and relaxing tax write-offs of bad debts to spark The government must separate investment funds from bank management to ensure shareholders' interests are a priority, not the credit activity of the parent bank, he said. \"The government should prohibit bankers from the credits side of the business (from sitting) on company boards,\" he said.\nIMPORT CURBS MAY HELP AS WESTERN ECONOMIES STAGNATE\nJosef Poeschl, Czech specialist at the Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies (WIIW) said that the immediate problem was the poor economic performance of West European economies.\n\"It is an economic law that if a stagnating economy is trading with a growing one, the latter will be faced with a deterioration of the trade balance,\" he said.\nPoeschl suggested imposing temporary import surcharges and higher taxation on some commodities which are mostly imported.\n\"But if the Czech deficit does not shrink, a devaluation (of the Czech crown) will remain the only way out.\"\nWORRIES ARE EXAGGERATED, EXPORTS WILL GROW NEXT YEAR\nSome economists said the government should not panic.\n\"The increase of the trade deficit will stop in 1997 at 150 to 160 billion crowns,\" said Kamil Janacek, chief economist at Prague's Komercni Banka.\nIn 1997, the first effects of an investment wave will be felt, boosted by reviving demand on EU markets, especially the acceleration of economic growth in Germany, he said.\nThe Czechs will also benefit from a partial re-orientation of exporters toward neighbouring post-communist countries and the former Soviet Union.\nJanacek said there will be a market-based weakening of the crown, from currently above parity with the central bank mark/dollar basket to below parity in the first half of 1997.\n\"This will help to accelerate exports, and to slow down imports,\" he said.\nDEVALUATION WOULD DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD\n\"We think the country's trade deficit will likely stabilise in 1997...so, as you can guess, we have plenty to say about what the government shouldn't do,\" said Boris Gomez, analyst at ING Barings in Prague.\nHe pointed to a positive, yet gradual shift of exports from commodities to sophisticated finished goods, and development of eastern export markets with higher economic growth potential.\nA crown devaluation \"is not a painless cure and would do more damage than good to the small and open Czech economy that is heavily dependent on imports at this stage\".\nIt would \"generate a wage-price spiral\" and hurt credibility, Gomez said. Import surcharges would also sap the economy of needed modernisation.",

He said last-minute changes to the text could not be ruled out.\nFinal approval from the CSU, a partner in the Bonn coalition, would depend on assurances that the Sudeten Germans, as they are known, would be \"involved at an appropriate level\" in a dialogue between Prague and Bonn, he said.\nThe Bavarian-based CSU has in the past hinted it could use its weight in the government to block the declaration or oppose the Czech Republic's application to join the European Union unless the Sudeten Germans were given better terms.\nIn the Czech parliament the mainstream parties have backed the declaration, but the extreme-right Republican Party and far-left Communists have ruled out voting for it in any form.\nMembers of the largest Czech opposition party, the Social Democrats, whose votes may be crucial for approval by parliament, said on Sunday that they still had concerns about vaguely-worded compensation for victims of Nazi aggression.\n\"(The party) has done all it can for the declaration to be accepted, but it still expects a bit more work (on the text),\" a Social Democrat senator from the once German-annexed district of Upper Moravia, Petr Moravek, told Czech Television.\nStanislav Gross, the head of the Social Democrat caucus in the house, was quoted in the daily Pravo on Monday as saying he would not vote for the declaration in its present form.\nThe Czech foreign ministry said in a statement that Zieleniec and Kinkel would \"sign a protocol on the completion of negotiations of the Czech-German Declaration of mutual relations and their future development\".\nThe full declaration, leaked to news media last week, contains mutual expressions of regret for the Nazi occupation from 1938 to 1945 and for excessive brutality during the post-war expulsion of the Sudeten Germans.\nThe text angered groups representing families of the Sudeten Germans, who complained that it did not compensate those who had lost property during the expulsions.\nThe declaration sets up a Czech-German Future Fund with the German side paying in 140 million marks ($90 million), and the Czechs paying about one-seventh of that.\nThe text says the fund is to finance \"projects of common interest\" including joint environmental, historical, and scientific projects, youth meetings, and partnership projects.\nBut the text adds that: \"The German side acknowledges its obligation of responsibility to all who became victims of National-Socialist violence. That is why the projects, wherever appropriate, should work mainly for the benefit of the victims of National-Socialist violence.\"\nGerman Chancellor Helmut Kohl is expected to visit the Czech Republic, probably on January 21 and 22, to sign the text with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.\nIn early February Czech President Vaclav Havel and German President Roman Herzog are expected to address the parliaments of each other's countries in ceremonies giving final approval to the declaration.",

Ceska Sporitelna has had some stakes privatised through the voucher-privatisation programme, but the state still holds a 45 percent stake.\nThe CNB and the Finance Ministry have both called for the fast privatisation of the state's roughly one-third stake in Investicni a Postovni Banka to a strategic foreign partner. Japan's Nomura and Dutch ING NV are widely seen as frontrunners seeking IPB shares.\nTosovsky said the roughly 49 percent stake in the largest commercial bank, Komercni Banka a.s. should be divided into smaller units and sold to a variety of investors, not a single foreign strategic partner.\n\"As concerns Komercni Banka, there is no rush as concerns the privatisation but no reason to delay as well,\" he said.\n\"(Komercni), in our opinion, doesn't need a foreign strategic partner, and there could be small stakes and more investors could be invited to enter into the this bank.\"",

        "Text": "British building materials group Blue Circle Industries Plc produced tentative signs of a turnaround at its troubled European heating operations on Tuesday, and promised a ten-fold increase in heating profits over the next three years.\nThe company also launched a blistering attack on the government, blaming \"disgracefully low\" infrastructure spending for a slide in its British cement sales.\nThe recovery in heating, together with continued strong performances in the highly profitable Chile and Malaysia markets and the USA, helped lift Blue Circle's interim pretax profit by 11.7 percent to 116.3 million pounds ($181.5 million), at the top end of analysts' forecasts, with the interim dividend rising by 6 percent to 4.25 pence.\nAgainst a background of a weak stock market Blue Circle shares closed down 5 pence at 372 pence.\nThe heating operations, which are undergoing a major restructuring focused on France, Germany and Britain, posted operating profits of nine million pounds in the six months to June, up from just 100,000 pounds a year before.\nBut Britain's biggest cement producer also warned that it saw \"no significant signs of recovery\" in the key British cement market, and said it expected 1996 sales to be down four percent from 1995's depressed performance.\nIan McKenzie, chief executive of the group's British cement business Blue Circle Cement, blamed poor housing starts and low government infrastructure spending, warning that if the underspend continued \"the damage done to the competitiveness of British industry would be very great indeed.\"\nWorries about cement were offset by strength overseas and signs of early progress in turning around heating, which encouraged analysts to maintain full-year profit forecasts.\nChief executive Keith Orrell-Jones told Reuters the group's aim of achieving annual cost savings of 25 million pounds at the division is \"well up to programme,\" with nine million pounds coming through this year and the full benefit seen in 1997.\nOrrell-Jones said he was confident Blue Circle could achieve a 15 percent return on its 600 million pound investment in the struggling division, or some 90 million pounds, within three years, despite sluggishness in Germany and France.\n\"We are disappointed with the performance of the economies of both those countries, and we think it is not likely to ease very rapidly,\" said Orrell-Jones, adding \"that is why we set a three-year time horizon\" for recovery.\nWith gearing a miniscule 1.5 percent at the end of June, Orrell-Jones said Blue Circle was actively looking for opportunities to expand.\n\"We'd like to grow our cement business: it depends on where the opportunities crop up. In the U.S. it's a question of waiting for the right opportunity and the right time in the cycle,\" he said.\nBlue Circle is \"actively looking in South-East Asia, and we are taking a very careful look at India,\" he said, adding that it was also interested in expanding its south American operations beyond Chile and into Argentina.",

The stock has risen more than 13 percent since the start of the year.\nIn an update of its product portfolio, Medeva also announced a tie-up with small drug discovery group Peptide Therapeutics Plc which could see painful injections against illnesses such as influenza, typhoid and tetanus replaced by nasal sprays or capsules.\nThe two are also investigating a vaccine against the E-coli bacteria, which has killed 17 people in a recent outbreak in Scotland. Medeva said it spent three million pounds ($4.90 million) taking a 2.5 percent stake in Peptide, whose shares soared nearly 20 percent to 289 pence.\nBut the market's main focus was on prospects for the hepatitis B vaccine, Hepagene, which many analysts see as a huge potential money-spinner. In an interview with Reuters, Medeva chief executive Bill Bogie said Hepagene could eventually sell \"millions of doses\" a year, and carry a three-figure price tag.\nThe vaccine is targeted at a significant group of people who do not respond to existing Hepatitis B vaccines, such as SmithKline Beecham Plc's Engerix-B.\nMedeva sees a large market for it, especially among health workers and police who are routinely protected against the infection.\nStill more exciting is the drug's potential to treat people who are already infected with Hepatitis B, which is 100 times more infectious than HIV and kills two million people a year around the world. Bogie said tests on people who do not respond to the current treatment, Interferon, showed a 38 percent response rate.\nMedeva will decide later this year whether to expand production capacity for Hepagene at its plant in Speke in northwest England or to look elsewhere for extra output.\nA major surprise was Medeva's declaration that it would seek regulatory approval for Hepagene in Europe and the United States in 1998, opening up the prospect of first sales in 1999. Bogie said this was a sign of confidence that Medeva would win outstanding battles over patents on both sides of the Atlantic.\nIt won a key judgement in Britain's House of Lords against U.S. rival Biogen Inc last year. Bogie said Medeva would not be seeking marketing partners for Hepagene beyond its existing agreement with Johnson & Johnson to sell Hepagene in southeast Asia.\n\"We are not looking for a partner. That does not mean they won't happen but we are fairly confident we can do it ourselves,\" he said.\nMedeva, whose executives spent Thursday morning with analysts, also announced plans to go ahead with development of a purified form of its most profitable product, the behaviour-controlling drug Methylphenidate.\nBogie said the new version of the drug being developed by Chiroscience Group Plc would give Medeva important patent advantages over rivals and cut down the number of times a day Methylphenidate is taken.",

        "Text": "British chemicals group Albright & Wilson Plc said on Monday that a keenly-awaited drop in raw materials prices had failed to emerge.\nIn an interview with Reuters, Albright & Wilson chief executive Robin Paul said although costs had stabilised after sharp gains last year \"there has still been a small net increase, which has meant that any improvement in our performance has had to come from our own efforts, whereas we had been hoping for some reduction.\"  \nCost increases have affected the performance of the whole industry, and added an extra 40 million stg to Albright & Wilson's bills in 1995. The Birmingham-based group is the world's biggest and lowest-cost producer of wet phosphoric acid, used in a wide range of processes from putting the tang into fizzy drinks to making soap powders. Rises in phosphorous prices, especially in China and the rest of Asia, partly eroded gains from strong demand for phosphates in the first half.  \nPaul, who steered Albright & Wilson back onto the stock market last year after 17 years as a subsidiary of U.S. giant Tenneco Inc, said another threat on the horizon was the continued strength of sterling, which could raise the cost of exports from the UK and reduce foreign earnings.\n\"Where this isn't expected to have a substantial effect on 1996 results, because most of the contracts are in place, it is causing us to look very hard at the 1997 budget because of inevitable pressures on translation and transaction,\" Paul said.  \nHe added it was difficult to quantify the impact of the pound continuing at current high levels, although he said strength against the dollar would act as a \"net hedge\" by lowering raw material costs.\nAlthough phosphorous-derived products have driven profits since its foundation in 1851, Albright & Wilson also produces specialty chemicals, including flame-retardants for protective clothing and furniture, and surfactants, foaming and wetting agents used in detergents and soaps.  \nPaul said in some ways the company's relaunch had come at a difficult time, with its first set of interim results as a newly independent company in 1995 heralding a worldwide downturn in the chemical industry as higher costs ate into profits.\nThe group's share price has clawed its way back from a low of 152 pence last November to stand at 177 pence early Tuesday afternoon after touching a peak of 207 1/2 pence in September. But Paul warned that shareholders and analysts should not expect \"one-year spectaculars,\" especially in terms of a share buyback.  \nNews at the start of the year that the group had sought authority for a share buyback caused some excitement, particularly given its low gearing, which stood at just 14 percent at the end of June. \"The directors got permission to buy back shares, but without plans to do so,\" Paul said. \"People read rather more into it than was justified.\"\nNor will cash be used for acquisitions, unless they \"tidy up\" shareholdings in associates or offer technological benefits. Paul said growth would be organic, with a reinvigorated research and development program producing a range of new products, including improved water treatment and flame-retardant chemicals and a breakthrough to stop paints from flaking.\n\"We are not looking for one-year spectaculars at Albright & Wilson. We have been around for 145 years and and even Tenneco's ownership (from 1978) could be seen in retrospect as a phase in the history of the company,\"said Paul. \"Our aim is to build up a solid performance year-on-year-on-year.\"",

However, trading in BP shares on the options market was active.\n\"People are still speculating on a fairly sharp rise in BP shares,\" one options specialist said.\n\"In a sense BP have spoilt us,\" said Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull analyst Irene Himona.\n\"We've got used to them coming out with a good set of numbers at the top of the range, and unfortunately with (rival) Shell it is the other way around.\"\nBP's results contrasted with disappointment last week at third-quarter figures from rival Royal Dutch/Shell Group, where profits fell on the back of low refining margins and a weak chemicals market.\nBP also emphasised the relative stability in its earnings, partly as a result of the vigorous cost-cutting at its exploration and production activities.\n\"They are very much on the ball and very focused. They have achieved a lot of efficiency improvements and delivered a lot of savings,\" said Himona.\nBP was upbeat about near term propsects, with oil demand expected to remain strong into 1997. But it said its long-term view that the oil price would settle back into arange of $16 to $18 a barrell had not changed. \"The question is how we get from here to there,\" said Browne.\nMorgan Stanley analyst Chris Buckley said the oil price was always the greatest uncertainty, but added that lower prices tended to mean margins could improve in downstream activities like chemicals and refining.",

        "Text": "A revolution in the treatment of HIV and AIDS is proving a godsend not just for patients but for drug companies which have poured millions of pounds into fighting the epidemic.\nCocktails of new and old drugs are resulting in dramatic improvements in both quality of life and life expectancy, with some patient groups forecasting that death rates from AIDS in Europe next year could fall by 50 percent.\nAnd as patients live longer and more people seek treatment at earlier stages of illness, drug companies like Britain's Glaxo Wellcome Plc are looking forward to a quantum leap in sales, with global turnover of AIDS and HIV products forecast to treble by the end of the century.\nAnalysts at Lehman Brothers expect sales of AIDS drugs at Glaxo Wellcome, which by a mixture of luck and good judgement holds two of the cornerstone drugs for combination therapy, to soar to around $2 billion by the end of the century from just $300 million in 1995.\nKeith Alcorn, who writes for the influential British newsletter AIDS Treatment Update, used by both patients and doctors, said: \"This year has been the most exceptional year in AIDS treatment yet, and the effects are very, very tangible. People are going back to work after being very ill and that in itself is quite unexpected.\"\nADVANCES REVIVE AZT\nAdvances have led to an extraordinary revival in the fortunes of Glaxo Wellcome's Retrovir. The drug, also known as AZT, was launched with a great fanfare in 1987, but its erratic performance disappointed patients and shareholders alike.\nDoctors have found that using Retrovir, which stops the HIV virus from replicating, in combination with other treatments such as Bristol Myers Squibb Co's Didanosine, Hoffmann-La Roche's Zalcitabine and above all a new Glaxo Wellcome drug called Epivir can radically cut levels of HIV in the blood.\nAnd preliminary evidence suggests the addition of a whole new class of drug, known as protease inhibitors, to the cocktail can produce even more sensational results, with the virus brought below detectable levels.\nLehman Brothers analyst Ian Smith said: \"Use of Retrovir alone had a relatively minimal and transient effect on CD4 cell levels (key cells which HIV destroys, undermining the immune system) and viral load. But in combination the impact on viral load and CD4 was nothing short of stunning compared to what we saw a few years ago.\"\nThe progress has electrified an industry that just two years ago was mired in gloom over prospects for a breakthrough in treating AIDS. Anita Kidgell, Glaxo Wellcome's antivirals product communication manager, said that when scientists, activists and drug companies met at the 11th International Conference on AIDS in Vancouver, Canada, in July the atmosphere had been transformed.\n\"We were seeing that one could reduce the levels of the virus in patients' blood to undetectable levels,\" Kidgell said.\nFor the moment Glaxo Wellcome seems to have cornered the AIDS drug market, with Lehman predicting sales of Retrovir will double to $600 million by 1998 and that sales of Epivir, which Glaxo shrewdly licensed from Canada's BioChem Pharma Inc in 1990, will hit $750 million by 2000 from just $12 million in 1995.\nBut other companies are ahead of the British giant in developing protease inhibitors, the third element in the cocktail, which block an enzyme crucial to the spread of the HIV virus within the body.\nSome 20 protease inhibitors are being developed, and Merck & Co, Abbott Laboratories Inc and Roche Holdings AG have all rushed versions on to the market this year. The three companies are cautious about giving sales figures, but anecdotal evidence from patient groups together with U.S. sales data suggests that Merck's Crixivan is far outselling its rivals. Sales of this class of drug are likely to reach around $300 million this year.\nNOTE OF CAUTION\nBut while there is understandable euphoria over the progress made to date, Robin Gorna, director of health promotion at Britain's leading AIDS charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: \"We must be very cautious about saying everything is OK, we have got a cure.\" She said the mix of drugs taken by AIDS patients carry a raft of side effects and enforce a strict and life-changing dietary regime and timetable.\nThe explosion in effective treatment also has serious consequences for overstetched health and insurance budgets.\nThe Terrence Higgins Trust estimates that costs to the British taxpayer in the year to March 1998 of treatment with Retrovir alone would be 10.3 million pounds ($17.29 million). Treatment with a combination of three drugs would bump this up to around 50 million. And if, as expected, more people are encouraged to come forward and seek treatment before they develop AIDS, this could rise to around 74 million pounds.\nGorna said stories already abounded of patients being unable to get the drugs they need, either though lack of funds or ignorance on the part of doctors. AIDS support groups and companies, who cooperate increasingly, say they have to persuade governments that extended treatment with drugs is much cheaper than costly hospital care and dealing with the multiple complications of AIDS.\n\"We are all very hopeful,\" said Gorna. \"It is looking good, but it really isn't over yet and we need drugs that are effective in the long term.\"",

        "Text": "Investors in the fast-growing British biotechnology sector can look forward to another roller-coaster ride in 1997, with serious profits still there to be made by investors who pick their stocks carefully.\nAlthough sharp falls in the value of the sector since its peak last May have underlined the riskiness of biotechs as an investment, analysts said 1997 should be the year when a host of companies publish data which will start to prove that the underlying technology can produce drugs that really work.\nIt should also see a number of businesses step out of the long shadow cast by British Biotech Plc, which continues to ride high on hopes that its cancer treatment Marimastat will be the sector's first wonderdrug.\nAmong those most keenly tipped for success next year are Biocompatibles International Plc, Celltech Group Plc, Chiroscience Group Plc, Cortecs International Ltd and Scotia Holdings Plc.\nAnd there are growing signs that other countries, notably France and Germany, will start to challenge Britain's domination of the European biotech industry. Britain currently has more biotech companies than the rest of Europe combined.\nSTOCKS STILL AHEAD DESPITE 1996 SETBACK\nAnalysts at Lehman Brothers said the end of a 14-month long run of gains by Britain's biotech stocks in May, since when prices have dropped by around 40 percent, jolted investors, leading many to question the real value of biotechs.\nBut the Lehman Brothers UK/Europe Biotechnology Index also shows that even after this setback, biotech stocks are still showing an overall gain of around 150 percent compared with the start of their bull run in February 1995.\nAnd in a note on the sector, Lehman said investors could buy into drug discovery and development in biotechs at a fraction of the cost of buying into the pipelines of mature companies like Glaxo Wellcome Plc and Zeneca Group Plc.\nNomura Equity Research analyst Nick Woolf also disputed another claim of recent months, that UK biotech stocks are vastly overvalued compared with the much larger U.S. sector.\nWoolf said a ratio of market capitalisation to five years of spending on research and development showed U.S. biotechs are valued at four to five times accumulated spending and British companies at between four and six times.\n\"We are not overvalued compared to the U.S,\" he said. \"When people say the U.K. is overvalued they are looking at British Biotech, but second place companies like Chiroscience, Celltech and Cortecs are all looking very good value.\"\nWoolf and Yamaichi International analyst Erling Refsum said investors had become much more choosy about which stocks to buy, but there was now a danger that people were being too cautious. Where a year ago people would put money into almost any biotech that could type out a prospectus, in recent months a number of small flotations and fundings have been scaled down or dropped.\nEven British Biotech was forced to turn to underwriters to rescue its 143 million pounds ($236.5 million) cash call in July.\nRefsum said the market was focusing too much on the 50 percent chance that a drug in Phase II trials would fail to get to market rather than the equal chance it would succeed. Woolf added \"I think it is the wrong way of looking at it. You should evaluate risk, but across a portfolio of companies where you are spreading the risk.\"\nISSUES TO WATCH IN 1997\nAmong key stocks to watch in 1997 will again be British Biotech, where clinical trials of Marimastat are entering the final phase. Although trials will not be completed until 1998 at the earliest, the company plans detailed updates on the drug, probably in May and November. Bad news is still expected to have a disproportionate effect on the whole of the sector.\nCelltech is singled out by Nomura, Yamaichi and Lehman. Nomura said Celltech is \"very good value,\" and Lehman have a target valuation of 10 pounds per share for the company by the end of this year compared with a price of 485 pence on Friday afternoon. Optimism about a septic shock drug, being developed with Germany's Bayer AG, and progress on a therapy for Acute Myeloid Leukaemia are seen as key drivers.\nCambridge-based Chiroscience, which Lehman values at 600 pence per share compared with last Friday afternoon's price of 312, is also favoured, amid hopes that a new local anesthetic will provide a flow of cash for an ambitious pipeline of novel drugs including cancer and arthritis treatments.\nUK-Australian group Cortecs is strongly tipped by Yamaichi's Refsum, who believes oral osteoporosis and insulin drugs could turn out to be $1 billion-sellers, while he also favours Scotia, which is in the unusual position of having three drugs nearing the market. Tiny Scottish group Shield Diagnostics Plc could be sitting on a product worth around $200 million a year if data due to be published in the first half of 1997 prove its diagnostic kit is an accurate forecaster of heart attacks.\nAnd Lehmans said contact lens and medical devices company Biocampatibles had \"enormous upside potential\". It said the stock could be worth 16 pounds by the end of 1997 compared with 693 pence on Friday.",

But analysts noted that it rose sharply last week ahead of publication, while the decision by Morgan Grenfell to sell a sizeable chunk of its holding on October 29 had mopped up much of the buying interest in advance.\nOxford-based British Biotech used a cancer conference in Vienna to make a number of presentations on trials of the drug in gastric, colo-rectal, ovarian and pancreatic cancer.\nIt said the studies, based on cancer patients who continued taking the drug after the 28-day period needed for Phase II trials, confirmed Marimastat's ability to reduce the rate of rise of cancer antigens, one measure of how much cancer is present in the body. It also provided evidence of succcess in gastric cancer, where a large scale trial is now underway.\nSome analysts said there was little new in the statement, which was largely a confirmation of Phase II, or intermediate stage, data published in May.\n\"Those who were sceptical in May will remain sceptical and those who were bullish in May will remain bullish,\" said one analyst who asked not to be named.\nFinance director James Noble said the company had been deliberately cautious in its comments to avoid raising false hopes among cancer sufferers. Nevertheless he told Reuters that \"In many ways I think this is the most impressive data since the company was floated.\nOne of the bulls, Greig Middleton analyst John Savin, said the real news was hidden in presentations made by doctors at the Vienna conference. He said that despite the \"mishmash\" of data from the trials, which covered 381 patients, there was \"very compelling\" evidence that Marimastat had improved chances of survival.\n\"On this information today we can say that...37 percent (of patients) had a real overall response which improved their survival chance significantly,\" Savin said.\nHowever, others expressed disappointment that British Biotech failed to provide more detailed analysis of side effects caused by Marimastat. British Bitoech confirmed that it caused joint pain, mainly in the arm and shoulder, with around 30 percent of patients affected after three to five months.\nYamaichi International analyst Erling Refsum said the side effect profile will be crucial to Marimastat's potential. \"Drugs become top sellers because of their side effect profile rather than because of their efficacy profile,\" he said.\nNoble played down concerns about side effects, saying \"they are not a serious problem. They are reversible.\" He said patients who suffer badly will be able to interrupt their treatment from time to time without any adverse impact.\nAnalysts pointed out that no real estimate of just how big Marimastat will be could be made until Phase III trials were completed. This means investors will have to wait until 1998 at the very earliest for hard evidence that their optimism about Marimastat and British Biotech is well founded.",

The drugs, known as leukotreine antagonists, are designed to prevent or reduce the severity of asthma attacks rather than relieve existing attacks.\n\"The Holy Grail for the treatment of asthma has been simple tablet formulation,\" said Barnes.\nAccolate was launched in the U.S, where steroid-based inhaled asthma drugs have never been as accepted as in Europe, in October. Although he declined to give details of sales, Barnes said \"experience has been encouraging,\" and added \"sales are fully up to our expectations.\"\n\"One of the most gratifying things has been the level of physician interest generated by the launch of Accolate,\" said Barnes, adding that the company had received \"a large number\" of inquiries from U.S. doctors about Accolate.\nEarlier today Zeneca announced a 21 percent expansion of its U.S. sales force to help it deal with a rush of product launches, including the possible launch of Seroquel and Zomig later this year.\n\"The migraine market is growing very fast indeed, it's a substantial market, and so far as one is able to judge from clinical data Zomig has faster onset of action and maybe more consistent results than the leading product , (Glaxo Wellcome's) Imigran.

        "Text": "British health and industrial gases giant BOC Group Plc reported its best-ever set of full-year profits on Tuesday, dispelling some of the gloom which has settled over its share price in recent months.\nBOC, one of the world's biggest suppliers of specialist gases, saw profits surge 11 percent to 444.9 million pounds ($745 million) despite problems caused by a stronger pound and a deterioration in the performance of its health-care business.\nSales climbed seven percent to just over 4.0 billion pounds.\nThe outcome was at the top-end of analysts' forecasts, which had been pared down after BOC issued cautious noises about its two non-core operations, health and industrial vacuums, along with third-quarter results on August 13.\nShares in the group, which have fallen from more than 940 pence since mid-June and touched 12-month lows on Monday ahead of the results, climbd 29 pence to 865 in early afternoon trading.\nIndustrial gases, which are used in industries as varied as foods, chemicals, metallurgy and water purification, saw operating profits rise nine percent to 408.3 million pounds on sales up 6.8 percent to 2.8 billion pounds.\nIn an interview with Reuters, chief executive Danny Rosenkranz said he expected profit margins in gases to improve by about two percentage points over the \"next three to four years\" from the 14.5 percent achieved in the year ended in September.\nHe said a major factor behind the improvement would be the huge increase in the number of 15-year supply contracts BOC has won in the U.S, which entail building gas-making plants next to customers such as steel works in return for guaranteed sales.\nThe Ohmeda health division, hit by continued falls in the price of BOC's once top-selling anaesthetic gas Forane and weak U.S. demand for anaesthetic machinery, was the only BOC unit to see operating profits fall, dropping 11 percent to 53.1 million pounds.\nRosenkranz said Ohmeda would continue to have a difficult time in the six months to March 1997 but should turn in a flat performance for the year as a whole, and \"...starting next year this thing ought to start climbing.\nThe market had also been braced for a poor performance at Edwards Vacuum Products, whose machinery creates super-clean environments for industry, because of a downturn in the overcrowded semi-conductor market.\nIn the event the loose alliance of business known as vacuum and distribution posted a 28 percent gain in full-year operating profit to 90.3 million pounds, although the gain in the fourth-quarter had slowed to just eight percent as the impact of a fall-off in semi-conductor orders started to bite.\nRosenkranz pointed to tentative signs of a pick-up in the computer industry, such as a rise in the October U.S. industry book-to-bill ratio. Nevertheless he said the vacuum business \"will see a decline in profits this year\", but did not predict its extent.\nUncertainty also remains over the impact of sterling, whose newfound strength ate into the gain in fourth-quarter profits, trimming their advance by three percentage points to around nine-percent.",

        "Text": "Shares in perennial bid favourite Zeneca Group Plc spiralled higher once more on Thursday, but analysts said it was on the thinnest of pretexts.\nThe stock touched a new record of 17.25 pounds during the morning session, with the rise once more triggered by speculation about the intentions of Swiss drugs giant Roche Holding AG. -- hotly tipped by takeover theorists as the only company rich enough to buy Zeneca.\nNews that Roche had named Franz Humer as chief operating officer combined with talk in the press that Humer is keen to ensure Roche does \"not play second fiddle\" to his old employer Glaxo Wellcome fuelled the latest rise, traders said.\nWith few people willing to sell Zeneca stock in case they miss out on any takeover, which could be worth $30 billion, the stock is being continually squeezed higher.\nSociete Generale Strauss Turnbull (SGST) analyst Peter Laing said Zeneca shares, which have gained 37 percent this year, are now at \"eye-popping\" levels. SGST believes that a hostile bid is implausible at current valuations, and, without this, the stock's current rating is increasingly hard to justify.\n\"Is it valid for a stock which is only two-thirds a drug stock and the rest agro-chemicals and specialty chemicals to be on the same premium as Pfizer?\" said Laing, who argued that the current gains are a story of \"supply and demand.\"\nCash-rich Roche is widely believed to want to make a large acquisition, both to reassert its position as number one in Switzerland and to counteract the shortfall in new drugs coming through the industry's pipeline.\nBut some analysts and industry executives believe that Zeneca would not necessarily be its chosen target.\nOne industry source said he believed Roche would be much more interested in the U.S. company Schering-Plough Corp, which had a similar market capitalization to Zeneca. He said Roche had eyed Schering Plough on a number of occasions.\nSchering-Plough would offer Roche a much stronger footing in the key U.S. market than Zeneca, and it would plug gaps in Roche's existing infrastrucure, offering the Swiss group badly-needed muscle in the non-hospital and U.S. over-the-counter sectors.\nHowever, analysts said Zeneca had a more attractive pipeline of new drugs than Schering-Plough. And as the world's second-biggest cancer drug company after Bristol Myers Squibb Co it would also boost Roche in a key therapeutic area.\n\"I am quite sure that at the right price several companies would like to acquire Zeneca,\" said Panmure Gordon analyst Robin Gilbert, adding that good quality medium-to-large businesses like Zeneca and Schering-Plough are few and far between.\nBut Gilbert said Zeneca, which is \"firing on all cylinders\" since its split from chemicals group ICI Plc in 1993, is determined to remain independent.\n\"They believe they have a future as an independent company, and obviously they don't agree with the size philosphy of people like Glaxo Wellcome,\" Gilbert said.",

And by October 8 this year Rhie said it had already sold another 18,500 units.\n\"Our target when we launched was one percent market share in three years. We have already reached that,\" Rhie said.\nDaewoo, which likes to advertise itself as breaking the mould of car supply in Britain, launched itself through cleverly targeted publicity, including surveys of customer likes and dislikes.\nRhie summed up customers' pet hates as \"too much hassle\" from salesmen and poor aftercare once the sale was complete.\n\"It is like a wedding, with the customer as the bride. Before, they say I love you, darling,' and all that, but after the marriage they forget,\" Rhie said.\nDaewoo was the first company to offer three years' free servicing on all models and packed its cars with extras including airbags and mobile phones.\nIt has also led a revolution in all-inclusive pricing, a trend followed this week by GM unit Vauxhall Motors and by Porsche AG with its new Boxster sports car.\nBut Rhie said its U.K. strategy was not applicable to all markets, particularly those where the relationship between car producers and dealers is even more entrenched than in Britain.\n\"The UK market is more sophisticated than many other countries. The level of (consumer) awareness is higher.\"\nDaewoo has encountered severe criticism from rivals, some of whom are alarmed at the speed with which it has penetrated the British market, where it has overtaken longer-established names like Saab, Mitsubishi and Hyundai.\nSome question whether its pioneering servicing agreement with the Halfords superstore chain can provide the level of support for customers that it claims.\nDaewoo's response to criticism that its current range of models is outmoded will be to launch three entirely new cars at the end of 1997. Rhie said one of these, known as the J Car, had been developed largely by its U.K. R&D operation in the southern town of Worthing, which employs nearly 1,000 people.\nRhie declined to state Daewoo's next target for U.K. market share. \"Quantity is very important but that is not the final goal,\" he said. \"Our aim is a customer focus and how to continuously follow up customers' requirements.\"",

        "Text": "New evidence about British Biotech Plc's anti-cancer treatment Marimastat next week will provide important clues about its potential as a blockbuster product, analysts said on Friday.\nBritish Biotech is using a meeting of the European Society of Medical Oncologists (ESMO) in Vienna to make five presentations, including Marimastat's effects in ovarian, colo-rectal, pancreatic and gastric cancer.\nIt will issue a general update on Monday morning.  \nThe Oxford-based group has become the bellwether for the increasingly crowded biotech field in the U.K, with sentiment towards Marimastat having a disproportionate impact on the sector.\nMillions of pounds of investors' money has been placed on the bet that Marimastat will turn out to be Europe's first big-selling biotech product, with forecasts for annual sales ranging from a few hundred million dollars to up to $4 billion.  \nMonday's data comes from patients who continued to use the drug beyond the period necessary for completion of Phase II clinical trials. The company said this meant there would be a further six months of extra information.\nYamaichi International analyst Erling Refsum said he hoped to see the first hard evidence that patients were living longer as a result of taking Marimastat. Refsum said the surrogate marker data provided so far was like \"the indicator board at the train station rather than the train actually coming.\"  \nIn a note on the trials Lehman Brothers analyst Ian Smith, who will attend the ESCO meeting, said it might be possible to glean indications of the effect of Marimastat on patient survival in ovarian and pancreatic cancer.\nThere will also be interest in Marimastat's impact on gastric cancer, where little information has so far been available. And analysts are keen to see how serious the side effects caused by the drug are. The main problem reported so far is joint pain.  \nYamaichi's Refsum said the results are \"not definitive as  to whether it works or not, but it is another indication as to whether it will sell or won't sell, and that is the bottom line.\" Lehman's Smith added that the results \"won't prove Marimastat's efficacy but will raise the probabilities.\"\nBritish Biotech will announce late-stage data on another key product, pancreatitis drug Lexipafant, on November 27.\nSmith said that favourable news on both drugs could lift the group's share price to 300 pence by the end of the month from 230 at Friday's close. But Refsum is more sceptical about the potential impact of Marimastat and said 150 pence is \"reasonable value\" for the shares.\nA British Biotech spokeswoman said Phase III Marimastat trials are likely to take two years to complete, meaning that the first results would not be available until 1998 at the earliest. But she said British Biotech would probably make academic presentations at conferences like ESMO from time to time to keep the market up to date.\nLate stage trials on pancreatic cancer started in June, and trials in small-cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer and a form of brain cancer are being set up, she added.",

Resolutions demanding the board step down were withdrawn just before the start of another extraordinary general meeting in February 1996.\nZwanziger accused Enviromed of eroding shareholder value through poor management and of holding firesales of assets, including the disposal of a dental distribution business and veterinary diagnostic operation, as it sought to cut debts.\nIn turn Enviromed accused Zwanziger of trying to gain control of the company \"via the back door\", and challenged him to launch a full takeover bid.\nEnviromed's value began to plunge in December 1994, the month that Murphy was appointed, as a pretax profit of 2.2 million stg in the year to September 1994 turned into a loss of 8.2 million stg a year later. The company's market capitalization fell from around 28 million stg to just over 6.0 million.\nMurphy vehemently rejected blame for the collapse, saying he had inherited a pile of problems he and other board members had worked hard to resolve.\nOne of the new board's first goals will be to appoint a finance director. In a letter to shareholders ahead of the extraordinary meeting Zwanziger said the new board would focus on the development of the enzyme buisness Biozyme which it said was already profitable.",

Industry analysts said Northern Electric might end up agreeing to a takeover if it could extract a higher price.\nOmaha, Neb.-based CalEnergy, through its 70 percent-owned CE Electric unit, said it would pay 630 British pence ($10.06) for each common share and 103 pence ($1.64) for each preferred share of Northern Electric, making the deal worth about $1.23 billion. The U.S.-based construction and mining company Peter Kiewit Sons owns the other 30 percent of CE Electric.\nNorthern Electric successfully fended off a hostile bid last year from Trafalgar House, now owned by Sweden's Kvaerner, by offering a special package worth 560 million pounds ($894 million) for shareholders.\n\"Our strategy is to become a leading global provider of a full range of energy services,\" CalEnergy Chairman David Sokol said in a statement announcing the offer.\nSokol's company has invested in geothermal and other energy projects at home and in Indonesia and the Philippines in recent years. Its core operations are in California, New York and Texas, and the bid for Northern Electric is a major move outside the U.S. market.\nU.S. utilities, faced with slow growth and deregulation in their local markets, have been merging in the United States and investing abroad as they seek to grow.\nSokol said Northern Electric, based in northeastern England, had distribution and supply know-how that would complement CalEnergy's production capacity, while its size was \"very manageable.\"\n\"They are the smallest regional electricity company and that means that you can get them cheaper,\" said one analyst who asked not to be identified.\n\"We will see an agreed bid eventually,\" said Philip Hollobone at brokers Williams de Broe, who said CE Electric might eventually raise its price to secure agreement from Northern's board of directors.\nIn its statement rejecting the bid, Northern Electric said that in talks through Sunday, CE Electric had contemplated offering about 700 pence ($11.17) per share.\n\"Northern Electric is clearly saying you can have us for 700 pence per share,\" said one sector analyst who asked not to be identified.\nCE Electric, which bought a 12.7 percent stake in Northern in the open market, said that it never suggested \"any intent to value the company at 'around 700 pence per share' or even anywhere close to this figure.\"\nSokol said he felt the offer was \"a very full price,\" adding that CE Electric had sought a merger agreement with Northern Electric but \"the only area we could not agree on was value.\"\nSome analysts said Northern Electric's weak balance sheet would limit what CE Electric would be willing to bid and that it might be hoping to attract another bidder. The special shareholders' package it paid to fend off Trafalgar House left it heavily in debt.\nNorthern Electric stock jumped 131 pence ($2.09) to close at 651 pence ($10.40) after CE Electric had managed to buy its 12.72 percent stake at the offered price earlier in the session.\nCalEnergy announced in August that it bought three gas-fired cogeneration plants in Texas, Pennsylvania and New York for $226 million from Falcon Seaboard Resources Inc., a closely held energy company.",

Industry sources expect the results to come some time next week.\nNorthern could boost its case with an improved gearing forecast after a 560 million pound ($918.6 million) package for shareholders which helped it fend off last year's bid from Trafalgar House.\n\"The critical answer is interim results, especially the balance sheet, which could be stronger than expected,\" said David Campbell of Greig Middleton.\nNorthern has said that CE Electric, which is 70 percent owned by CalEnergy of the U.S., had indicated a price of 700 pence per share, but that claim was denied by the Americans, who said their $1.225 billion bid was a full and fair price.\nSince the bid on Monday, there have been no further talks between the companies, industry sources said, and CE Electric has snapped up around 13 percent of Northern's shares.\nThe share price has struggled to rise above the offer level, which was at a premium of 21.2 percent to the last closing prices before the bid, and On Friday was trading at 631.5 pence, down two pence.\n\"I think Northern should be able to force a higher price but the critical factor is portfolio investors, who may prefer an instant 630 pence rather than a possible higher number,\" said one analyst who asked not to be named.\nNorthern's costly defence against Trafalgar House, the only successful rebuttal by any of the eight Recs which have faced bids since privatisation in 1990, has left it with little more to offer, analysts said, which could keep a lid on the shares.\nThere is also scepticism a rival bid will emerge, as the remaining four independent and cash-rich Recs could be more attractive without the operational rationale of CE Electric, which wants to add supply expertise to its generating business.\nElectricity sector shares were led higher last Friday by East Midlands Electricity, which was seen as the most attractive bid candidate before CE Electric launched its offer for Northern.\nNorthern is likely to report pretax profits slightly down at around 50 million pounds from 58.7 million pounds a year ago and raise the dividend by seven percent to near 13 pence.\nGearing could come in around 125 percent and show signs of falling to 100 percent or less, analysts said, from peaks nearer 170 percent under the impact of the costly defence package.\nThe market is also waiting for CE Electric, in which U.S. construction, mining and telecoms company Peter Kiewit Sons has a 30 percent stake, to post its offer document. This move will set the 60-day clock ticking for the takeover timetable.\nAt the same time, electricity industry watchdog Offer has started a review of the bid, requesting comments by November 7.\nAnalysts said Offer's move might have contributed to dampening Northern's share price by triggering concerns the bid might be referred to British competition authorities.\nThere appears to be little precedent for such a referral, however, as three Recs have already fallen to U.S. companies with approval from the government.\nBut last week's surprise decision to block rival bids for water utility South West Water from its colleagues Severn Trent and Wessex has unsettled the market, analysts said.\nThe Conservative government, well behind the opposition Labour party in opinion polls with no more than six months to go before a general election, might see Northern's takeover as a political hot potato.\nLabour, traditionally against privatisation and fiercely critical of takeovers in the sector, might take an additional interest in Northern as it supplies the party leader Tony Blair's constituency in north east England.",

The Community Pharmacy Action Group, which lobbies on behalf of pharmacies, said its removal could mean the closure of one in four local outlets.\nThe OFT's request goes to the Restrictive Practices Court which is unlikely to be able to consider the issue before late 1997, Bridgeman told a press conference.\nRetailers therefore did not appear to be about to start an immediate round of price cuts.\nChemist and beauty products store chain Boots said it was disappointed at the decision and believed that RPM \"operates in the public interest.\"\nBoots has not reduced prices of such medicines during a long-running inquiry into price-fixing and industry sources said it was unlikely to take that route in the near future.\nUniChem, a pharmaceuticals wholesaler and retailer, said removal of RPM would be \"immaterial to...profitability,\" while Superdrug, the high street chemist chain owned by Kingfisher, welcomed the move but ruled out immediate price cuts.\nSupermarket retailer ASDA, which has led the campaign over the last year to have RPM removed after successfully lobbying for it to be withdrawn from books, also welcomed the OFT's decision, saying it could save consumers 300 million pounds ($476 million) on everday healthcare products.\nBut it said its stance on prices would not change.\n\"RPM is still in place, we are still in the same situation we were in yesterday and we will still be in it tomorrow,\" a spokesman said.\nASDA is currently refusing to sell Anadin Paracetamol, a painkiller produced by Whitehall Laboratories, and large packs of indigestion treatment Alka Seltzer, after it baulked at manufacturers' price increases.\nIt has launched a range of some 40 own-brand OTC medicines and vitamins selling for as little as half the price of branded equivalents, and says they have helped it extend market share.\nAlso on Friday, ASDA said it was launching an initiative to help support local pharmacies, shops which chief executive Allan Leighton told BBC television he had no wish to see put out of business.\nShare analysts said that removal of RPM on non-prescription medicines could see specialists such as Boots increasing market share, reflecting events after RPM was taken off books when specialist retailer W H Smith increased market share.\n\"Smiths got stronger, increasing market share through promotions and using muscle with suppliers. I expect the same will happen to Boots - it'll get bigger and stronger,\" said Nick Bubb of MeesPierson.",

I think it is a 50-50 shot,\" said Gordon Culfeather, utilities analyst at Greig Middleton.\nSeven of the original 12 cash-rich Recs have now been sold in a flurry of takeovers since they came up for grabs last March after the government's protective golden share expired, five years after privatisation in 1990.\nThree of those have been sold to U.S. utilities, who see the UK sector as an opportunity to expand outside U.S. regulatory shackles, particularly into a market which is scheduled to be liberalised to supply competition in 1998.\nThe latest bid is from  U.S. energy group Dominion Resources which agreed to pay 1.3 billion pounds ($2.15 billion) on Wednesday to take control of East Midlands Electricity, one of only five remaining independent Recs, in an a offer at 670 pence per share.\nNorthern Electric faces its second hostile approach in less than two years as it battles to throw off a 630 pence per share bid from CE Electric, a unit of U.S.-based CalEnergy, which has already snapped up 29 percent of its target.\nOnly two bids have so far been blocked by trade secretary Ian Lang, who stunned the market by stopping generators National Power and PowerGen from consuming two Recs earlier this year.\nAnother two Recs fell prey to their regional water and sewerage companies, while industrial conglomerate Hanson picked up Eastern Electricity, which it now aims to spin off as part of a separate business under its demerger plans.\nThe remaining victim was Manweb, which succumbed to Scottish Power, an aggressively expansive electricity generator and distributor based in Scotland.\nDominion and East Midlands said they saw no reason for their deal to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC), adding that a meeting was scheduled with industry watchdog Offer, which initially consults on bids.\n\"If Lang was following a consistent route, he would not stop these latest bids,\" said one analyst who asked not to be named.\n\"But if I were a regulator, I would probably want at least five firms to make comparisons,\" he added.\nOffer head Stephen Littlechild will send his advice on both bids to Lang for the trade secretary to decide whether they should be referred to the MMC.\nAnother pressure on Lang is the prospect of a general election, which must be held by May 1997, with the opposition Labour party running ahead in opinion polls and allegations of sleaze miring the current Conservative government.\nIts privatisations, which have seen most of Britain's strategic industries sold off, have been heavily criticised for huge executive pay packets, hefty shareholder payouts and heady takeovers which value firms well above privatisation levels.\nLabour, which has vowed to levy a \"windfall\" tax on privatised utilities, said in an opening salvo on the latest bids that it planned \"tough, efficient regulation wherever necessary in the privatised utilities and we intend to see it enforced whoever is the owner.\"\nLang could chose to refer the bids to the MMC in order to delay any decision on this hot political issue beyond an election, some analysts said.\nThe market on Wednesday showed its concerns by capping share prices at well below the bid levels, with Northern trading at 592 pence per share by 1450 GMT and East Midlands at 623 pence.",

There could be more consolidation. They have to respond,\" McFadden said, adding that calculations suggested a 2.9 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) tag for C&W's Mercury unit after the deal.\nTelewest Communications shares jumped 12 pence to 135, while General Cable gained 18 to 197 pence.\nThe British cable market is growing fast, with around 7.5 million homes now within striking distance of connections, as around six billion pounds has already been invested in building cable networks and a further six billion is planned.\nThe new company will eclipse its rivals in terms of market share, with 2.47 million homes within reach, compared with its nearest rival, Telewest, with around two million.\nBut analysts said it would not be in direct competition with other cable network companies as they mainly operated in different franchises.\nCable & Wireless Communications may flex its muscles in securing more favourable terms for programming from BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has a 40 percent stake, analysts said.\nBSkyB shares were down 16-1/2p to 680p, after touching a low of 678p.",

Thames Water, which kicked off the flow of interim results in the sector on October 29, turned in pretax profits before exceptionals up 15 percent and raised its dividend 22 percent.\nSouth West Water has also committed to pay out a rebate of 15 pounds each to customers after the planned bids were blocked but Hill warned further rebates would not be automatic.\nThe company failed last year in a bid to have price caps imposed by regulator Ofwat raised as the Monopolies and Mergers Commission said it should find an extra 100 million pounds it said it needed for environmental upgrades from efficiencies.\nIt has since made an earlier rebate of 10 pounds to customers, announced additional investment of 74 million pounds and brought forward 20 million pounds of investment in cleaning up at Newquay, a favourite beach area for surfers. Hill said the company's strategy now was to \"focus on the core business...and develop very carefully the strategy of the non-regulated businesses.\"\nDividend payouts would be helped by efficiency savings and improved profitability in its non-regulated businesses, which contributed 6.6 million pounds to interim profits, executives told a press conference.\nChairman Keith Court told journalists the company aimed to balance turnover contributions of non-regulated and regulated businesses \"as soon as we can.\"\nNew acquisitions contributed around 3.5 million pounds to operating profits of some 7.5 million pounds in non-regulated business this year and Hill said there was between 100 and 200 million pounds available to make further purchases.\nBut there are no specific plans for acquisitions. \"Our track record shows...we are not frightened (of making acquisitions) but it is a question of finding ones that make sense,\" Colin Drummond, head of the group's non-core division, said.\nAt the same time, the company's balance sheet was strong enough to effect a share buyback if it decided to make use of a mandate to buy 10 percent of shares, Hill said.",

Moreover, some political analysts believe it may be impossible for Colombia to regain U.S. certification as an ally in the fight against drugs, withdrawn in March, unless extradition is reintroduced.\nSamper, dogged by accusations that he took drug money to finance his 1994 election campaign, said on Friday he thought Giraldo's bill was poorly timed, arguing that priority should be given to a package of tougher penalties for drug crimes currently going through Congress.\nJustice Minister Carlos Medellin has spoken out in favour of renewing extradition, however, and Alfonso Valdivieso, chief prosecutor and a fervent anti-drug crusader, has even called for extradition to be made retroactive -- a proposal unlikely to please those drug traffickers who surrendered to the Colombian authorities in return for lenient treatment.\nWhile politicians, ministers and lawyers argue the merits of the move, more than 60 percent of ordinary Colombians surveyed by RCN radio in September said they opposed extradition.\nPolitical analysts say such opposition reflected a combination of nationalistic pride and fear that renewing extradition could unleash a new campaign of bombings, kidnappings and assassinations like those led by the late drug lord Pablo Escobar in the late 1980s and early 1990s.",

Police said they did not know the motive behind the attack.\nThe explosion came a day after a 120-pound (50-kg) car bomb went off in Medellin, killing a woman and injuring 48 people.

Human rights groups accuse cattle ranchers of backing them.\nDefence Minister Juan Carlos Esguerra said, however, that he believed Monday's attack in Medellin was retaliation for approval last week by Congress of a new law to strip drug lords of their billion-dollar fortunes.\nColombia's main cities, and particularly Medellin, were scarred by a drug-fuelled campaign of bombings, assassinations and kidnappings in the late 1980s when cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar waged war on the state in a successful bid to ban the extradition of Colombians to the United States.",

Scores of others clutched photos in silent tribute to their loved ones -- kidnapped by criminals.\n\"When you're abducted, you become like the living dead -- it strips you of your soul.

He did not, however, say when the hike would take effect nor what the percentage rise would be.\nIn the provinces, meanwhile, coffee growers are becoming increasingly worried about potential crop damage caused by recent torrential downpours, which meteorologists say have pushed rainfall levels up to 160 percent higher than the seasonal average. Weather forecasters say the outlook for February is just as bad.\nUnder terms of the ACPC deal hammered out in Rio de Janeiro on Jan. 23, member nations will slash back total exports by 1.3 million bags in the first half of 1997 from the original target of 26.28 million bags set in May.\nOne million bags of that will be robusta but arabica- producing countries, like Colombia, agreed to rein back 300,000 bags of exports in solidarity. Cardenas declined to specify what proportion of the cut would correspond to Colombia.\n\"The cuts will respond to production conditions and the export situation in each individual country. We will be announcing the cuts this will imply for Colombia next week,\" Cardenas told Reuters.\nAs speculation grew this week that the federation would announce the rise in internal coffee prices at its first meeting of the year Friday, Jan. 31, private exporters complained of short supplies.\n\"Intermediaries and producers have increased prices to scandalous levels in anticipation of a rise in the internal coffee price. Some are just holding on and won't even sell. In some cases prices are up by as much as 10 percent,\" said Alvaro Ramirez of Cargill exporters.\n\"In view of the situation in external markets, we will of course have to raise the internal price of coffee,\" Cardenas said. \"We will do the projections and take the decision on the basis of that,\" he said.\nThe federation cut internal coffee prices by 14,000 pesos per 125-kg load to 221,500 after a turbulent coffee growers' congress on Dec. 5. The move aimed to reduce the deficit of the Coffee Fund, an organization administered by the federation which buys all Colombian coffee at a pre-agreed support price.\nThe cut was achieved by withdrawing a 14,000 peso premium, paid in the form of a bond instead of cash, which had been introduced to compensate for the poor outlook for coffee in the 1996 calendar year.\nThe good news on the internal price front, however, is taking a back seat to the recent weather problems.\n\"In the southwest and Andean regions, and particularly the coffee growing region, rainfall has been as much as 160 percent higher than normal,\" said Leonardo Rivera, meteorologist at the national weather center IDEAM.\n\"These conditions will be prolonged and we're likely to see similar levels of rainfall through February,\" he added.\nJanuary and February are normally dry months in Colombia. But the torrential rains this year have been caused by a cooling in the surface temperature of the Pacific ocean, known as the La Nina effect -- conditions not seen for at least the last 10 years.\nCoffee growers say the rains are delaying the flowering period and fear the main harvest, which normally begins in October, could either be very late or that a part could be lost entirely.\nCardenas said it was too early to predict what the impact of the weather could be on crop levels but said federation technicians were drawing up a detailed report, which they hoped to issue in mid-February.",

        "Text": "British Petroleum Co Plc considers its Piedemonte prospect in eastern Colombia \"fundamental\" to its worldwide operations despite drilling problems and wrangles over the exploitation contract, a top company official said Thursday.\nJohn Doust, executive director of BP's local subsidiary, British Petroleum Exploration (Colombia) Ltd, predicted the field, still at the test stage, could come on stream by the end of 1999.\nHe estimated the total cost of developing the field, estimated to contain between 600 million and one billion barrels of crude and condensates, could run to about $2.2 billion, some of which would be shared by state oil company Ecopetrol.\n\"The oil project currently under way in the Piedemonte is fundamental for the worldwide organisation of the BP group,\" Doust said in a speech to journalists.\nHis recognition of the strategic importance of the 287,000 hectare block, in which BP has pinpointed three promising hydrocarbon formations after exploring just 15 percent of the total area, once again raises the question how BP will push the Colombian government for sweeter contract terms.\nBP, Colombia's single largest foreign investor, argues that given tough drilling conditions, the terms of its so-called sliding scale association contract with Ecopetrol makes it unprofitable to exploit the field.\nUnder the existing contract, Ecopetrol's share of the profits rise as production increases from 50 percent to a maximum 76 percent.\nBP has been pushing for a so-called R Factor contract -- which the Colombian government has so far denied -- which would take account of investment and operating costs to ensure adequate profit margins.\n\"We understand the uncertainty of the (Piedemonte) issue and the nature of the debate have caused uneasiness amongst many people... Let us keep in mind that we are truly seeking to achieve a break-even point and a platform of confidence for BP so that we can operate in an internationally competitive economic position,\" Doust said.\nLast month, Colombia's Mines and Energy Minister Rodrigo Villamizar proposed BP should hand back rights to the 85 percent of the block that is virtually unexplored with the guarantee that Ecopetrol would re-award BP half that area under R Factor conditions at a later date and contract out the remainder to other companies.\nDoust said BP was \"seriously considering\" the proposal. It is understood, however, that BP would be loath to surrender the rights to almost 50 percent of a block with huge potential under the current offer on the table.\nBP has recently been hit by allegations of indirect links to right-wing paramilitary death squads that have assassinated social leaders close to its operations in eastern Colombia.\nDoust blamed the accusations on a campaign to discredit the company and repeated earlier statements that he had invited the country's chief prosecutor to carry out an in-depth investigation into the claims.",

Schoene was kidnapped in mid-August by the ELN, which had demanded $6 million for her release.\nIn its press release, the chief prosecutor's office referred to Mauss and his wife as Juergen and Isabel Seidel -- one of their many aliases. The couple were remanded in custody.\nAn executive secretary of Siemens-Colombia said on Wednesday she had hired the plane that Mauss was to use for his getaway on the orders of a top industrialist formerly based in Bogota.\nSecurity experts say Colombia -- home to Latin America's longest-running guerrilla war -- is swarming with foreign mercenaries carrying out shadowy undercover missions as kidnappings reportedly run at almost one every 2-1/2 hours.\n\"Many multinationals are hiring so-called security advisers for kidnap, terrorist and extortion situations but these are simply mercenaries and adventurers willing to make pacts with kidnappers and guerrillas,\" said private security consultant Col. Luis Enrique La Rotta.\nParliamentarian Guillermo Martinez, a retired air force officer, told Reuters he was sure dozens of foreign mercenaries like Mauss had poured into Colombia to carry out hostage rescue missions.\n\"Regardless of whether the Colombian authorities can or cannot control the (kidnap) situation it is totally unacceptable for foreign companies to fly in mercenaries to do this type of work,\" he said.",

President Ernesto Samper vowed not to bow to terrorist violence from drug traffickers.\n\"We will not allow the specter of narco-terrorism to return to this country and intimidate us,\" he told reporters. \"The state will combat these acts of violnce head-on.\"\nFive unidentified gunmen, one of them a woman, opened fire on private security guards near Gomez's home before the bomb went off, Medellin police chief Gen. Alfredo Salgado said.\nHe said three houses were virtually destroyed and 15 others seriously damaged by the explosion.\nThe dead woman was identified as Lucia Cevallos de Bernal, 60, who lived near the site of the blast. Gomez was not home at the time but one of his three sons was injured.\nAuthorities offered a $150,000 reward for information leading to the capture of those responsible.\n\"This is a savage act. The first indications point to drug traffickers but I don't want to draw premature conclusions,\" said Defence Minister Juan Carlos Esguerra.\nThe attack came three days after the Colombian Congress approved a tough new law to strip Colombia's cocaine barons of their multi-billion dollar fortunes. Another bill to introduce stiffer jail terms for drug traffickers is due to come up for discussion in a special session of Congress later this week.\nBut it was not clear why Gomez, who is not a congressman, should have been targeted.\nGomez is a member of the opposition Conservative Party and head of the regional El Colombiano newspaper, which has its headquarters in Medellin, once home to the world's most powerful cocaine cartel.\nHis newspaper recently printed an interview with Carlos Castano, leader of a feared right-wing death squad, whose main target is leftist rebels and their supporters.\nA few hours after the blast an unknown group calling itself the Special Anti-Paramilitary Commando issued a communique, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, declaring war on paramilitary groups. The group claimed to be made up of ex-guerrillas who had previously laid down their arms and accused the state of sponsoring paramilitary groups.\nMedellin was scarred by violence in the late 1980s and early 1990s when drug lord Pablo Escobar waged a successful war to force Colombia's Congress to ban the extradition of Colombians to the United States.\nIn June last year a bomb killed 28 people in the city centre.

Ecopetrol's share rises as production increases, topping out at 76 percent when output hits 150 million barrels.  \nBP had been pressing for the entire Piedemonte contract to be renegotiated using the new-style Factor R, which takes account of investment and operating costs in individual fields to ensure adequate profit margins for foreign companies.\nBut those demands were rejected by Villamizar last month following a congressional debate. Villamizar's new proposal, however, would open the way for a Factor R contract to be drawn up on that area of the Piedemonte field which BP would cede and then win back. Ecopetrol would then operate the rest of field itself or contract it to other private oil companies.  \nGustavo Triana, a senior official of the powerful USO oil workers' union, known for its fierce opposition to multinationals, said the union would not readily welcome any \"underhand deal\" that granted better terms to BP after the government had said it would not do so.",

This will push up costs, reduce their cash flow and mean much of the stocks will be stored in remote areas, delaying dispatch,\" the coffee chief said.\nDespite the grim message that shifting trends in consumer countries could force their costs up higher, Lodder did offer a ray of hope for Colombian growers, already hard hit by the strengthening peso and the high cost of credit.  \nLodder highlighted the growing opportunity for niche marketing of specialist coffees in traditional markets where consumer palates are becoming more sophisticated even though the overall demand in those areas may have stagnated.\nHe also talked up prospects of new markets opening in the former Soviet Union and China. Colombia's President Ernesto Samper, and his official delegation, returned from the Far East at the end of last week. His itinerary included China and both he and his Foreign Minister Maria Emma Mejia were upbeat about the chance of selling the Colombian bean to the country's 1.3 billion-strong population.  \nDuring the visit to Beijing and Shanghai, Mejia calculated that if Colombia could sell one cup of coffee a day to every inhabitant of China, the Communist nation would absorb Colombia's entire annual harvest.\nNational Coffee Growers' Federation chief Jorge Cardenas did his own calculations and worked out that Colombia would have to double its coffee harvest if it was looking to meet Mejia's target.\nIn his speech, Lodder recognized the ICO's changing role and agreed it was no realistic for it to adopt interventionist strategies in a globalized free market.  \n\"The patterns of economic and political cooperation seen in the 1960s have been replaced by a new  model, perhaps more realistic and certainly different. There's no consensus for a return to intervention but the ICO is a dynamic organization and it must reflect the current situation and not be constrained by its former role,\" he said.\n\"I believe the ICO must remain flexible and look for the broadest possible consensus and build on the foundations of our cooperation with trade experts.\"\nHe added that the ICO would concentrate on looking for specific solutions to specific problems as they arose throughout the coffee sector either in production or marketing.\nMeanwhile, Colombia's transport system got back to normal this week after a crippling 11-day strike by truckers, which ended with an agreement early last Friday.\nThere has, nevertheless, been a significant delay in coffee deliveries and Cardenas forecast that about 150,000 60-kg sacks of coffee promised for October delivery would not in fact reach buyers until November.",

A spokesman said the device contained just a few ounces (under 100 grams) of explosive and was probably simply intended to sow panic.\nAt least 1,100 people have been abducted this year -- more than half of those by warring factions in Colombia's simmering internal conflict -- according to march organisers.\nNational Police chief Rosso Jose Serrano, who took part in the first march of its kind in Colombia, saw it as a direct challenge to leftist guerrillas, who fill their war chests with ransoms. Scores of others clutched photos in silent tribute to their loved ones -- kidnapped by criminals.\n\"When you're abducted you become like the living dead -- it strips you of your soul. Today's march is a sign that civil society is saying no to kidnap,\" said Francisco Santos, founder of Pais Libre, an independent foundation that counsels kidnap victims' families and which organised Sunday's march.\nSantos, part of the family that runs Colombia's leading newspaper, was kidnapped six years ago as part of a campaign unleashed by the late drug lord Pablo Escobar and his Medellin cartel.\nIn a move timed to coincide with Sunday's protest, one of Colombia's most-feared right-wing paramilitary leaders released the mothers of two guerrilla chieftains in the northwest.\nThe women were snatched in a wave of retaliatory kidnappings carried out by Carlos Castano's paramilitary gang in the last six months in a bid to persuade the guerrilla chief to halt its campaign of abductions.\nAn estimated 15,000 to 20,000 people took part in the march. Organisers put the figure at twice that.\nNorberto Garcia, 62, tearfully watched the march and subsequent rally in the historic Plaza Bolivar square. Almost a year ago to the day his 14-year-old daughter Andrea disappeared on her way to school in a working-class district of the capital.\n\"When your child is kidnapped it is like your own life ends.

It rose just 11.8 percent in peso terms in 1996 -- a real-term loss when set against 21.63 percent inflation.\nMedellin's IBOMED index has leapt more than 23 percent after losing 3.68 percent in nominal terms in 1996.\nTrading volume is extremely thin, however.  Volume on all three of the country's exchanges, including Cali's tiny Bolsa de Occidente, totalled just $2.3 billon in 1996.  \nMarket perception that Colombian shares are well below book price, a fall in deposit rates from above 30 percent for most of 1996 to about 27 percent, and optimism that the economy is about to rebound from the sharp slowdown last year are underpinning the rally.  And a new tax on fixed income papers has also put a premium on equities, many brokers say.\n\"Once the market caught fire everybody piled in. There was not too much differentiation between shares, which shows these are still somewhat immature markets,\" said market analyst Stephen Edkins.  \n\"We're bullish about the year and think shares will rise between about 40 percent and 45 percent overall,\" he added. Inflation is forecast to hit 18 percent this year, which would mean real-term yields of up to 27 percent.\nEdkins expected to see downward corrections of between five percent and 10 percent in the coming weeks, with new gains from the start of the second quarter as companies turn in 1996 year-end results, followed by first quarter results.\nDomestic political factors, including the country's simmering guerrilla war, which some military experts predict will intensify in 1997, seem unlikely to cause concern.  \n\"We've got this crazy equilibrium where there's quite a solid macroeconomic management and then this element of chaos,\" said Edkins.  But amid the optimism, bourse chiefs Caballero and Uribe sounded a warning.\n\"The main underlying problem is that there are a lack of shares.  That's a structural problem and cannot be resolved overnight,\" said Caballero.\n\"There are favorable terms for companies to raise capital in the stock market but the traditional marriage between industry and the financial sector is not going to be easy to break up,\" said Uribe.\nColombian entrepreneurs still prefer to contract debt with the banks rather than risk losing overall control of their businesses by issuing shares.\nOf all the country's major conglomerates only the Sindicato Antioqueno has more than one of its companies quoted on the stock market -- but less than one-third of the shares are in free float, outside the direct control of the companies themselves.",

This doesn't mean truckers will now be making any profits but at least we won't be operating at a loss like at present,\" Suarez told Reuters in a telephone interview. \"We have also agreed to set up a joint committee that will look at future transport policies.\"\nKey sectors of the economy, primarily those linked to import and export, had issued stiff criticism of the transport paralysis earlier in the day but heaved a collective sigh of relief with news of the agreement.\nBut the lifting of the strike seems unlikely to offer an instant fix for the crisis-hit coffee sector, which has seen 250,000 60-kg sacks of coffee -- a quarter of that promised for October delivery -- delayed by the truckers' action.\nEarlier in the week, private coffee exporters said many would be forced to default on this month's delivery contracts even if the stoppage ended before the weekend because of the backlog of coffee in port and in warehouses.\nIn addition to the raise in freight cargo rates, a joint committee of truckers, industry representatives and Transport Ministry officials will be created to look at other concerns highlighted by the drivers' association, Transport Minister Carlos Hernan Lopez said.\nThese include the cost of highway tolls, the price of operating licenses and associated taxes and maximum load restrictions on cargoes.\nPart of Thursday night's agreement means the Transport Ministry will send a communique to transport companies ordering them to lift unilateral bans on contracting the services of drivers operating trucks more than 11 years old where these are currently in force.\nSuarez said he did not think the deal hammered out would have an impact on inflation, already running above the 18 percent originally targetted at this point in the year by the government.\n\"Hopefully we will not see any gains in inflation or the cost of this accord being passed on to the consumers because the intermediaries, the transport companies, will be absorbing the cost of it by taking a cut in their profit margins,\" he said.\nThe overall cost of the strike is difficult to calculate but certainly runs into many million dollars.

Alfredo Salgado said.\nAbout 120 pounds (50 kg) of dynamite was packed into a minibus and detonated outside the house of Juan Gomez Martinez, a regional newspaper editor and former provincial governor.\nFour unidentified gunmen opened fire on private security guards near Gomez's home before the bomb went off about 5:30 a.m. (1030 GMT), Salgado said.\nThe dead woman was named as Lucia Bernal, 60, the wife of a civil engineer, who lived close to the site of the blast. Gomez was not home at the time but one of his three sons, Juan Camilo, was injured.\n\"We don't know the motive for this attack. It is too early to say who was behind it. We don't know if it was leftist guerrillas, drug traffickers or right-wing paramilitaries. We're looking at all the possibilities,\" Salgado said.\nGomez, a member of the opposition Conservative Party, is head of the regional El Colombiano newspaper, which has its headquarters in the industrial city of Medellin, the main city of Antioquia province.\nIn recent days it has been serializing an extensive interview with Carlos Castano, leader of the country's most-feared right-wing death squad, whose main target is leftist rebels and their suspected supporters.\nA few hours after the bomb blast a hitherto unknown group, calling itself the Special Anti-Paramiltary Commando, issued a communique, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, declaring war on paramilitary groups in Antioquia.\nThe organisation, claiming to be made up of ex-guerrillas who had laid down their arms, accused serving state governor Alvaro Uribe, of the Liberal Party's right wing, of sponsoring the paramilitaries. Uribe lives close to the site of Monday's blast but it was not clear whether the communique and the attack on Gomez's house were linked.\nMedellin has in the past seen some of the worst violence unleashed by the country's powerful drug cartels. It was the scene of multiple attacks by the notorious drug mafia led by the late Pablo Escobar in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The cocaine kingpin waged war against the state in a successful bid to force Congress to ban the extradition of Colombians to the United States.\nLast week Congress approved a tough new law designed to strip drug lords of their illicit billion dollar fortunes. More measures including stiffer jail terms are due to be debated in an extended session of Congress this week.",

Jesus Armando Arias said Peru's President Alberto Fujimori should not cave in to the demands of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) to free jailed comrades.\nElite forces from the United States, Israel or Britain could flush out the rebels with a \"minimum of bloodshed\" if they refused to negotiate, Arias told Reuters.\nMore than 100 people, mostly hostages and including 11 top judges, died in the 27-hour battle Arias led to dislodge M-19 guerrillas from Bogota's Palace of Justice in Nov. 1985.\n\"Training techniques have progressed rapidly and there are elite forces that have the ability to seize back the (Japanese embassy residence in Lima) with the minimum of blood and damage,\" Arias said in a phone interview.\n\"But given the strong international interests in this case the Peruvian government should try to negotiate and reach an agreement. Bowing to the MRTA's demands on releasing prisoners would, however, set a dangerous legal precedent,\" he said.\nArias, who now teaches at a military academy, said he still believed the assault he led was the correct tactic. \"The M-19 broke in killing people right, left and centre. We could only respond in kind to that type of violence,\" he said.\nTelevision images showed tanks firing 90mm shells into the courts building before smashing down the steel entrance doors remain vivid. Dynamite and automatic weapons fire reduced the interior of the building to rubble. More than 11 years later it has still not been fully reconstructed.\nAnother official involved in that incident, former Justice Minister Enrique Parejo, said the Colombian military ignored the government's orders and went ahead with the assault. He said Fujimori must keep a tight control on Peru's military if he wanted to avoid another bloodbath.\nFive years before the Palace of Justice attack, the M-19 stormed the Dominican embassy in Bogota. It held 57 hostages, including 19 diplomats, for 61 days before Fidel Castro intervened and negotiated the rebels' safe passage to Cuba.\nThe M-19 leader who led the Dominican embassy siege, Rosemberg Pavon, called on the MRTA earlier this week to keep its cool and offered to act as go-between in the Lima drama.",

There was no immediate comment from Lonrho on the report.\nStakis, which has some 46 British hotels, has refused to comment on reports it planned to buy the five Metropole properties. But the hotels and casino group remains the clear favourite to clinch a deal.\n\"It would be an excellent fit for Stakis. It's just the size of the deal that could cause concern,\" said analyst Fraser Ramzan of Lehman Brothers.\nMarkets have speculated that Stakis was planning a rights issue to fund the purchase of the Metropole hotels, valued at about 350 million pounds.\nThe Metropole group comprises five business and conference hotels located in the British cities of London and Birmingham and the seaside towns of Brighton and Blackpool.\nHotelier Millennium & Copthorne, floated in London this year, has effectively ruled itself out of the race. A company spokesman said Millennium had looked at the Metropole hotels but was not in talks to buy them.\nMeanwhile. Prince al-Waleed is believed to be negotiating the purchase of the Princess chain, 10 properties of resorts in the United States, the Caribbean and Mexico.\nFinancial sources in the Gulf told Reuters this month that al-Waleed had exclusive rights to negotiate a deal at a price of $300 million. The prince has major investments in New York's luxury Plaza hotel, the Four Seasons hotel group, in the banking group Citicorp and Disneyland Paris theme park.\nThe hotel business is in a growth phase as economic recovery on both sides of the Atlantic help drive occupancy rates.\nBut there have also been a glut of hotel companies coming to Britain's market, with Jarvis Hotels and Thistle following the example of Millennium & Copthorne.\nAnd there are signs of investor indigestion, as witnessed by recent cancellations of stock market floats.\nAnalysts said investors were now looking much more closely at the merits of individual companies but said they still expected the sector to remain positive into 1997.\n\"Over the past year, people have become far more discerning about the type of hotel business they become involved in. But that does not mean they are reluctant to invest in the sector,\" said Greg Feehley of Kleinwort Benson.\nAnd if that is the case, there is also no shortage of property on the market, with British media and leisure group Granada selling 17 luxury hotels in Britain and overseas.  The hotels, known as the Exclusive range, were acquired by Granada as part of the 3.9 billion pound takeover of leading British hotelier Forte last January.\nAmerican hotel companies ITT Sheraton and Marriott are reportedly among potential purchasers for the chain. A deal is expected to be concluded around the turn of the year.",

Ladbroke acquired HIC in 1987.\nIn the alliance grouping 400 hotels in 49 countries, HHC and HIC intend to cooperate from next year on sales and marketing, loyalty programmes and hotel development.\nLadbroke also announced first half pre-tax profits of 72.8 million pounds ($113.5 million) before exceptional items, a 29 percent increase on last year and above analyst forecasts. The interim dividend was unchanged at 2.4 pence per share.\nLadbroke shares added 7.5p to a 1996 high of 215p in early trade before slipping back to close 2p firmer at 209.5p.\nThe alliance gives HHC a larger presence in the international hotel arena.

Camelot, which has faced a storm of criticism over its jackpot earnings since the lottery was launched two years ago, reported pre-tax profits of 31.5 million pounds on sales of 2.1 billion pounds for the 24 weeks to September 14.\nThis compares with pre-tax profit of 36.2 million pounds and sales of 2.51 billion pounds in the same period a year ago.\nCamelot's five shareholding companies -- Cadbury Schweppes, De La Rue, GTech UK, Racal Electronics and ICL shared a total dividend payount of 10 million pounds, up from 9.5 million.\nSales for the weekly National Lottery game rose two percent to 1.68 billion pounds.

The two also operate a joint venture known as Concert which serves customers in more than 50 nations.\nAnalysts are speculating on a price of $40 a share -- valuing MCI at $28 billion and leaving BT with a bill of about $22.1 billion to pay for the remaining 80 percent of MCI.\nThe deal would be the biggest yet in the rapidly changing telecommunications market and the second largest involving a U.S. company -- topped only by the buyout of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.\nA BT spokesman confirmed that the BT board was meeting over the weekend to consider an anticipated proposal from MCI.\nHe would not be drawn on where the meeting was taking place, saying only that BT chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield was not in the United States.\nThe spokesman said an announcement was anticipated prior to the opening of the London stock market on Monday. Sources close to the talks said no announcement was likely on Saturday.\nBT and MCI have both said there are no assurances that an agreement will be reached or that any transaction will be consummated.\nBT had unsuccessful merger talks earlier this year with British rival Cable & Wireless -- a deal which would have created the world's fifth largest telecoms group by revenue.\nAny BT/MCI deal would spawn a massive company with a market capitalisation of some $64 billion, just ahead of AT&T Corp -- the leading, but struggling, U.S. phone company. It would still be some way behind Japanese giant NTT Data Corporation -- the world's largest.\nAnalysts said a merged company would be a good fit in the ultra-competitive U.S. long-distance phone industry where MCI and number three Sprint have been battling AT&T.\nIts critical mass would leave it excellently placed to expand into other international markets and new technologies -- MCI possessing the biggest Internet backbone in the U.S.\n\"This is AT&T Corp's worst nightmare,\" said consultant Jeffrey Kagan of Kagan Telecom.\nAT&T said late on Friday that it was confident any MCI/BT deal would receive proper scrutiny by the U.S. government.\n\"We would expect that our government would condition any such merger on the complete and unqualified opening of the telecom market in the United Kingdom,\" it said.\nHowever, analysts regard the British market as broadly open to competition.\nFor its part, Britain's Trade and Industry Department (DTI) said on Saturday it was too early to say what regulatory hurdles any merger would have to clear.\nOne potential problem is a media joint venture between MCI and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. BT would end up with MCI's 13 percent non-voting stake in News Corp and this could cause regulatory difficulties in Britain.\nBritish telecoms watchdog Oftel recently banned a joint advertising campaign between BT and satellite broadcaster BSkyB, a company in which News Corp is the main shareholder.",

The government is expected to announce its decision by early to mid-December.\nThe BBC, which calls itself \"the world's most successful cultural institution\", derives 95 percent of its funding from the annual fee payable by all television set owners.\nThe fee stands at 89.50 pounds ($150) and provided income of 1.8 billion pounds in the last financial year -- far outweighing the 77 million pound net benefit from the BBC's expanding commercial arm. The licence is guaranteed as a source of BBC funding for the next five years.\nBBC Director-General John Birt launched his campaign for what he said would be the first real increase in the licence fee in over a decade at a conference in Edinburgh in August.\n\"If the BBC is to sustain the existing level of services; if it is to remain as creative and dynamic an institution in the 21st as it has been in the 20th century; if it is to innovate with high quality services in the new technologies...we shall need a real increse in the level of the licence fee,\" he said.\n\"Neither a new leap forward in efficiency, nor a vigorous drive to increase our commercial revenue will be enough.\"\nThe BBC is believed to be seeking a rise of around five pounds -- which would generate extra revenue of more than 100 million pounds. Annual inflation is currently 2.7 percent.\nBirt's call has received a cool reponse from the ruling Conservatives and opposition Labour, wary of pinning a price rise on more than 20 million households in the run-up to a general election. The new rate would take effect in April while the election must be held by the following month.\nRecent newspaper reports said that National Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley has settled for a five-year formula that would leave the licence fee unchanged in real terms.\nThe reports said that Bottomley would offer higher rises in the second and third years to help fund new digital services and commercial projects but that increases in the following two years would be pegged below inflation.\nThe BBC, which runs two television channels and five national radio stations and has an enviable reputation as a quality public service broadcaster, has stepped up its campaign.\n\"You want us to do things. We want to do them. Now please give us the means and we can get on with the job,\" Will Wyatt, chief executive of the BBC Broadcast division said in a recent speech.\n\"We have called for only a modest increase, but one which would enable us to achieve a disproportionate amount of good.\"\nThe BBC points out that it has cut its cost base by almost 20 percent over the past three years and increased programme investment by 300 million pounds.\nThe licence fee debate comes as the broadcasting industry is set to be revolutionised by the move to digital transmission.\nDigital technology converts sound and pictures into binary digits -- a series of noughts and ones. It increases picture quality, multiplies the number of channels that can be broadcast and allows for the creation of interactive services.\nPay television operator BSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is the leading shareholder, plans to launch a digital satellite service with some 200 channels into Britain from next year.\nBSkyB, one of the corporate success stories of the 1990s, is Britain's leading pay television operator with more than five million subscribers. Its top package of premium films and live sports events costs subscribers 324 pounds per annum.\nA terrestrial digital service, broadcast from land-based transmitters and offering some 36 channels, is expected to begin by mid-1998.\nThe BBC plans to use digital technology to offer all licence payers supplementary programming to its core BBC1 and BBC2 output plus a 24-hour news service. It plans to make them available via satellite and terrestrial distribution.\nThe BBC expects to retain a share of around a third of all viewing and listening in 2005, down from 45 percent as the number of channels multiplies and the market fragments.\nThe digital expansion creates fresh opportunities for the corporation to develop its BBC Worldwide commercial arm.\nWorldwide is in negotiations with partners in Britain and the United States over the creation of a number of subscription channels, exploiting its strengths in areas such as comedy, drama and natural history.\nIts partner in Britain is Flextech Plc, while it is working with Discovery Communications Inc on channels for international markets. Leading U.S. cable television operator Tele-Communications Inc is a major shareholder in both companies. It aims to launch its UK services in mid 1997.\nSome media figures doubt the sustainability of the licence fee as subscription and pay-per-view services proliferate.\nDavid Elstein, chief executive of Britain's new Channel 5 commercial television network, said recently that he believed that pay-per-view would eventually \"consign the licence fee to history, where it belongs\".",

Sports Council chairman Sir Rodney Walker said that Wembley won out as it had greater potential to attract major international events.\nThe Sports Council has supported the English Football Association's bid to host soccer's World Cup in 2006 and the British Athletics Federation's attempts to attract the world championships in 2001.\nBut Manchester did not lose out completely as the Sports Council announced it had agreed in principle to provide up to 60 million pounds towards a new Stadium of the North to be used to host the Commonwealth Games in 2002, which have already been awarded to the city.\nIt said it would also consider backing Manchester council's bid for 20 million pound in funding for a new swimming and diving complex in the city, another Games facility.\n\"The Sports Council has agreed a 200 million package of financial support which will provide further opportunities for English and British sport to develop as a leading competitor on the world stage,\" Walker said.\nA competition is to be held to select an architectural firm to design the English National Stadium at the site owned by Wembley Plc.\nArchitect Sir Norman Foster has already unveiled his radical plans for an 80,000-seater stadium.\nIn his design, Wembley's famous twin towers would be repositioned to form a new gateway to the stadium area. The stadium would also be spun round 90 degrees with a new North/South axis.",

        "Text": "Britain's commercial television watchdog on Thursday invited applications to run terrestrial frequencies which will multiply the number of channels available to viewers in the new digital age.\n\"This is a very important day for UK viewers...as many as 35 or 36 channels could be available on digital terrestrial television,\" said Peter Rogers, chief executive of the Independent Television Commission (ITC).\nThe ITC is seeking applications to operate four \"multiplexes\", as the blocks of frequencies are known. Each block can carry as many as six digital channels.\nThe BBC has already been earmarked its own multiplex, and commercial networks ITV and Channel 4 will share one.\nThe ITC will award the 12-year licences on critieria including speed of roll-out of the service and the appeal of programming but a cash bid will not be required. Licences are expected to be awarded next spring and broadcasting could begin by mid-1998.\nBritain is leading the way in the development of digital terrestrial but some observers question whether it will succeed.\nPay television operator BSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is the largest shareholder, plans to launch a digital satellite service into Britain in late 1997 -- several months ahead of the terrestrial version.\nThe satellite version could offer several hundred channels and BSkyB's control of key movie and sporting rights are likely to make it an attractive proposition.\nThe ITC's Rogers told a news conference he was confident the terrestrial option would prove attractive to investors.\n\"I would be surprised and disappointed if we didn't have applications for all of the multiplexes,\" he said.\nHis view was shared by Paul Styles, a media expert at consultancy and accounting firm KPMG.\n\"Most people perceive digital bandwith to be valuable so I think there will be interest in the multiplexes,\" he said.\n\"This will not be an overnight sensation but a business to be built,\" he said, identifying ITV companies, cable groups and BSkyB itself as potential licence applicants.\nDigital technology increases the number of channels which can be transmitted and enhances sound and picture quality. it also enables interactive services such as home shopping and home banking to be created.\nDigital means converting sound and pictures into binary digits -- a series of noughts and ones -- rather than transmitting them as electric signals as now happens. A set-top box or \"decoder\" will be required to receive digital services.\nThis is also a source of controversy, as ITC officials admit that there is no current UK or European legislation to enforce a common standard for decoders.\nThat means that consumers could theoretically have to pay several hundred pounds (dollars) for a set-top box to receive BSkyB's digital services and then have to buy a second box a few months later to receive digital terrestrial.\nBritish Labour Euro MP Carole Tongue on Thursday wrote to European Commissioner Martin Bangemann to demand that all set-top boxes provide a common interface for all broadcasters.",

That was down on the pre-tax figure of 71.3 million pounds a year earlier but that had been flattered by a large one-off gain.\nMore pertinently, analysts had forecast profit in a range of 57.5 to 61.6 million pounds and the failure to reach that level was reflected in a 10.5p decline in the share price to 670p.\nThe company said that the market for electronic components has shown much lower levels of growth in 1996 than in recent years and added it did not expect any major change in conditions for the rest of the year.\n\"I think the evidence is we've bottomed the cycle and the signs at the moment are positive. But we are planning on a more conservative basis at this moment in time,\" chief executive Howard Poulson told Reuters.\nPremier said its priorities were the development and international expansion of the catalogue business and further exploitation of synergies between its transatlantic operations.\nPoulson said he was delighted with progress on integration following an acquisition which had transformed the company, based in the northern English town of Wetherby, into the third largest electronic components distributor in the world.\n\"The integration is going superbly..I am very pleased with what people have done on both sides of the Atlantic,\" he said.\nHe said he did not see any further scope for cutting costs following the acquisition.\n\"I think we've finished with all of the cost-cutting. This was never a deal which was built on reducing overheads and getting rid of people,\" he said.\n\"We said we would remove duplication in our two head offices -- we've done that, we've probably dropped about 150 people since we made the acquisition.\" The company now has some 6,500 staff, 4,000 of whom are in the United States.\n\"What the business is about now is building sales and building our profits that way,\" he added.\nPremier Farnell said its sales expansion projects were on schedule and should begin to make a contribution in the fourth quarter of the year.

Sprint is allied with the French and German companies in the Global One international venture while AT&T is part of a network of alliances called World Partners.\nThe new company, to be called Concert, plans to take on AT&T's dominance in the U.S. long-distance market, where MCI now has about 20 percent of a $75 billion business, and to win part of the $100 market for residential local phone service.\nIt also is expected to expand in the Asia-Pacific region -- a long-held aim for British Telecom.\nBritish Telecom's stock jumped in London and New York, where its American shares rose $5.375 to $60.875 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading.\nMCI shares also rose, but only 50 cents to $30.75, well below the possible value of as much as $39 a share based on the price of British Telecom's American shares. Worries about regulatory hurdles and the time to complete the deal held back the stock, industry analysts and takeover specialists said.\nThe merger still needed to win approval from regulators in America and Britain.\nBritish Telecom said it was optimistic that the European Commission would clear the merger.\nBritish officials have said only that they were looking at the deal. AT&T has already called on the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to give it thorough scrutiny.\nAT&T also said U.S. and European regulators should not give approval unless there is more competition in British Telecom's home market.\nBritish Telecom Chief Executive Sir Peter Bonfield has said it could take a year for the deal to win regulatory approval.\n\"There are a lot of hurdles to be cleared but I think the deal will go through,\" one London-based analyst said.\nFederal rules prohibit a foreign company from owning more than 25 percent of a U.S. telephone company if the acquiror's home market is not open to competition.\nUnder the merger British Telecom, which already owns 20 percent of Washington-based MCI, will issue Concert cash and stock for the remaining 80 percent. Holders of MCI stock will end up controlling around a third of the merged company.\nThe merged company will acquire the 9 percent stake which MCI holds in Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. media empire. MCI, perhaps wary of regulatory concerns, said on Sunday it did not plan to pursue an option to increase this to 13 percent.",

The home PC was transformed from a word processor into a high-quality game station and an educational tool for kids thanks to CD-ROM drives, speakers and soundcard packages and a bevy of new applications.\n\"Today, computers are faster than they were a year ago, but what does it do more?\" Lee asked. \"Demand is driven by applications and how it changes the typical consumer's life.\"\nSavvy consumers could just be waiting for lower prices, of course, and analysts said if they keep dropping, there may yet be a holiday buying burst. But without some hot new features, the shopping season for PC retailers could be a cold one.\n\"When you've got Intel moving up five in one day and Best Buy moving down three the same day, that tells you something ...

Investor sentiment is clearly shifting,\" said Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette medical technology analyst Steven Halper.\nAs the market turns cautious on loss-making start-ups, major manufacturers are entering a new period of abundance that makes them attractive, analysts said.\n\"This quarter will suggest that, in fact, the bigger companies are some of the best positioned in the medical technology field. They have a surfeit of new technology and new products,\" said Montgomery Securities analyst Kurt Kruger.  \nProducts are making it to market more quickly as well, thanks to more rapid U.S. Food and Drug Administration reviews. The agency approved 37 product marketing applications in its latest fiscal year, up from 27 in the prior year and 26 in fiscal 1994, according to Montgomery Securitities' count.\n\"This has reduced considerably the risk in bringing a new product to market and has important commercial relevance for the industry,\" Kruger said.\nContinued powerful growth in European and Asian consumer demand for U.S. medical devices also bodes well for U.S. companies big enough to take advantage of it, analysts said.  \nU.S. FIRST CALL CONSENSUS QTRLY EARNINGS FORECASTS\nCompany\t\t\t    Qtr  EPS estimate  Yr-ago EPS\nC.R.

Lilly was expected to record its first revenues in the third quarter from Humalog, a new short-acting insulin, analysts said.\nUnder close scrutiny will be Prozac, which accounts for about a third of Lilly revenues.

The study was conducted by the British-based Centre for Medicines Research, the agency said.\n\"In 1996, the U.S. is reviewing and approving ... faster than any other country,\" O'Hara said.\nHe credited internal reforms at the FDA largely to passage by Congress in 1992 of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which made more money available to the agency through a system of user fees imposed on companies.\nThose revenues have paid for the hiring of more reviewers and upgrading of FDA information systems, he said.",

Baird & Co analyst Walter Morris.\nMemtec wants Gelman's sophisticated membrane technology to put Memtec into closer competition with East Hills, N.Y.-based Pall and Millipore Corp, Morris said. \nPall -- much larger than either Gelman or Memtec -- wants Gelman to broaden Pall's medical and process businesses and \"frankly, to eliminate a pesky competitor,\" Morris said.\nGelman sales in fiscal 1996 ended July 31 were $112 million, versus $103.5 million in fiscal 1995. Memtec sales in the year ended June 30 were $175 million, up from $145 million in fiscal 1995. Pall had revenues of $960.3 million in fiscal 1996 ended August 3, up from $822.2 million in fiscal 1995.\n\"Pall under chief executive Eric Krasnoff has been more acquisitive than under previous management teams,\" said Morgan Stanley & Co analyst Mark Gulley.  \n\"If he does this deal, it will have been his third acquisition\" since taking the helm at Pall about two years ago, Gulley said.\nKrasnoff's acquisitions have tended to broaden Pall's presence in existing markets, rather than move it into new areas -- a pattern into which a Gelman acquisition would fit, said Fourteen Research analyst Anthony Ginsberg.\n\"There's good overlap ... They're in many of the same venues and markets,\" Gulley said.\nMorris said, \"Gelman is strategically important to both companies.\"\nArbitrageurs seemed to cast doubt Thursday on Memtec's contention that it plans to proceed with the Gelman deal by bidding up the Australian company's American depository shares as much as 3-5/8 in the morning. They lost ground in the afternoon to close up 1-15/16 at 28-15/16.\nThe rally in part was likely explained by short covering, arbitrageurs said.\nLate Thursday, Gelman issued a statement saying it intended to pursue its agreement with Memtec, but also to talk with Pall and any other interested parties.",

I see NextLevel Systems doubling over the next year to 18 months,\" Friedland said.\nShares in General Instrument were up 1/4 to 22-7/8 Tuesday after the Chicago-based company announced a three-way split designed primarily to unlock the share value of NextLevel.\nFor CommScope, to be built on the world's largest coaxial cable business, Friedland said management's goals are 18 to 20 percent annual sales growth and 16 to 17 percent operating income growth with operating margins of 16 to 17 percent.\nFor General Semiconductor, to be formed from General Instrument's electronic component manufacturing operations, goals are 10 to 11 percent operating income growth on annual sales growth of 14-16 percent and operating margins of 20-21 percent, Friedland told analysts at a meeting Tuesday.\nUnder the plan, General Instrument shareholders will get one share in each of the new companies for each General Instrument share held, Friedland said.\n\"We may have to do a reverse split to comply with New York Stock Exchange rules,\" he said, adding closing of the transaction is seen by July.\nNo layoffs or hiring are planned. \"There are no staff actions contemplated as a result of the transaction,\" he said.\nGeneral Instrument has primary goals in the restructuring, Friedland said. One is to unlock the value of the businesses that will comprise NextLevel, which analysts said has been held back by General Instrument's other segments.\n\"Electronic conglomerates are not looked at very favorably these days,\" said Michael Geran, industry analyst at the Pershing Division of Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette.\nThe other goal, Friedland said, has to do with General Instrument's heritage as part of the cable television industry -- a legacy that has overshadowed its newer technologies.\n\"We're going to continue to service the heck out of the cable base, but we're also getting into provision of dial tone and data. We need to break out of that mold General Instrument has been in of being a cable supplier,\" Friedland said.\nHe said the company decided to proceed with the break-up because it showed in 1996 that it could meet its business objectives, after failing to do so in years past. \"We've made that transition from development to deployment,\" he said.\nDeprived of cash flows thrown off by the CommScope and General Semiconductors businesses, NextLevel will fund growth two ways. \"We do have a lot of visibility to cash flow in NextLevel Systems now that we have the products going out the door,\" he said. \"So we feel that, while NextLevel Systems may be slightly cash negative in '97, even our downside scenarios say we have more than adequate capabilities.\"\nIn addition, he said, most of General Instrument's debt will be loaded onto CommScope and General Semiconductor, which can afford to service it. \"That leaves CommScope and General Semiconductor in fine shape in terms of their capital structure because they do generate the cash to pay this debt off in the near-term,\" he said.",

We think they're where they are because of a tightness between supply and demand ... But we're not making our investment decisions on those prices,\" Carl said.\nShares in Chicago-based Amoco rose 7/8 to 85-7/8 on Wednesday after the energy giant reported strong fourth-quarter and 1996 financial results.\nAmoco will likely spend about $550 million this year on exploration, compared to about $610 million in 1996, he said.\nThe company also is planning to hold its 1997 operating costs throughout the company flat at the 1996 level, he said.  \n\"You look at total operating costs as a company, they're basically flat, '97 to '96, on a planning basis. We're really pushing that responsibility down into the units. One unit to another unit might have job eliminations ... But we don't anticipate any wholesale, large restructurings like we announced in '92 and '94,\" Carl said.\nIn reporting results, Amoco said fourth-quarter chemical sector earnings fell versus the year-ago period and cited lower olefins and softened paraxylene product profit margins.\nOn paraxylene prices, Carl said, \"It looks like maybe they hit the bottom at the end of December\" near $0.19 per pound.  \n\"It may be that they're starting to firm up a little bit, but I think it's too soon to call that,\" he said.\nParaxylene traded on the spot market Wednesday near $0.22 per pound. \"Paraxylene prices appear to be coming up,\" said Salomon Brothers energy industry analyst Paul Ting.\nOn olefins, Carl said, \"Olefins is much tougher.

It has operations in 80 countries, primarily the United States, Canada and Britain.\nAfter its acquisition of Alexander & Alexander, Aon will become either the largest or second-largest insurance broker in the world.\nHow it will size up against rival giant Marsh & McLennan Cos.

The industry is in a mild recovery and it's probably a better time to own a rental car agency than it has been for a long time,\" said Jon LeSage, editor of Auto Rental News, a trade journal in California.\nFord declined to comment specifically on a published report that it may sell Budget to Team Rental Group Inc, a Florida-based Budget licensee, for $350 million.\nA Team Rental spokesman also declined comment.  \n\"No agreements have been reached among any parties,\" said Budget spokeswoman Kimberly Mulcahy, declining further comment. She said Ford does not own Lisle, Ill.-based Budget outright, but controls the company through an option to purchase its common shares.\nFord said last year it would exercise its option and buy out Budget's common shares, but analysts said the deal looks shaky now after delays resulting from a U.S. Federal Trade Commission antitrust review.  \nAs a result, A.G. Edwards auto analyst Michael Braigg in St. Louis said he expects Ford to sell Budget soon, likely to Team Rental. \"I think that one's pretty far along,\" he said.\n\"The real issue is that Budget is the small rental property of Ford. And if Budget is for sale, then so is Hertz in the long run,\" Braigg said.\nFord began investing in Hertz in 1987 at a time when U.S. automakers were buying up rental car agencies hoping to load up their fleets with the thousands of new cars that consumers were leaving on the lots.  \nThe strategy worked for a while, but then backfired when agency sales of barely used rental vehicles started eating into new car sales. Automakers began encouraging the agencies to hold onto fleet cars longer, which restricted how many new cars the agencies could take on.\nFord bought all of Hertz in 1994 and, unlike many rental car agencies, Hertz is probably profitable, analysts said.\nBut Magliano said, \"There is no big advantage to the automakers to owning these agencies anymore ... Probably along the way, Ford will sell Hertz. Generally, when these companies begin to divest operations, they get rid of them all.\"  \nReassured by a back-to-basics management trend running through U.S. industry, automakers started selling off rental car agencies in 1994 with Chrysler Corp's sale of Snappy Car Rental.\nGeneral Motors Corp in 1995 sold National Car Rental Systems Inc to private investors, who earlier this week resold National to Republic Industries Inc.\nSeeking to lock in supply for its fledgling AutoNation used-car chain, Atlanta-based Republic in November agreed to buy Alamo Rent-A-Car Inc.\nIn June last year, General Motors sold off its 29-percent interest in Avis Inc to HFS Inc, a real estate and hotel concern based in New Jersey.\nChrysler still owns Dollar Rent-A-Car and Thrifty Rent-A-Car. \"Our status today is that Dollar and Thrifty are very much a part of our everyday business. It's business as usual,\" said Chrysler spokeswoman Lori McTavish.\nShe added, \"It is Chrysler's goal, however, to focus on our core automotive business.\"\nBased on U.S. vehicle fleet size, Auto Rental News ranks privately held Enterprise Rent-A-Car, of St. Louis, as the largest U.S. rental car agency, followed in order by Hertz, Avis, National, Alamo, Budget, Dollar and Thrifty.\nTogether, Enterprise, Hertz and Avis own half of the U.S. rental car fleet of about 1.5 million vehicles, according to the trade journal.",

Still, the prognosis is cautious as the industry continues consolidating and faces controversy.\n\"It's not a super spectacular outlook, but it certainly looks better than 1995 and 1996,\" said Bear Stearns managed health care industry analyst Gary Frazier.\nThis year, medical costs, driven largely by higher prescription drug prices, rose faster than forecasts based on historical trends and left HMOs locked into premium rates that were too low to preserve profit margins. By early spring, the pinch was evident to Wall Street and HMO stock values from March to July declined sharply across the board.\nThirteen of the 16 largest publicly traded HMOs still have not regained first-quarter highs since the sell-off. The three that have are United Wisconsin Services Inc., Oxford Health Plans Inc. and FHP International Corp., which is being acquired by PacifiCare Health Systems Inc.\nGood recovery has been experienced by PacifiCare, WellPoint Health Networks Inc. and Aetna Inc., while only modest upward reversals have been made by industry giant United Healthcare Corp., Humana Inc. and others. Still reeling from the debacle are Coventry Corp., Mid Atlantic Medical Services Inc. and Physician Corp.\n\"Questions about pricing and margins still hang over the industry,\" said Salomon Brothers managed health care industry analyst Robert Hoehn.\nMedical cost inflation forecasts vary, but most analysts look for premiums to rise slightly faster than costs in 1997.\n\"The HMOs are starting to take some action by raising premiums, but the problem is they're really just catching up,\" said Peter Reilly, an actuary at the health care consulting firm of Milliman & Robertson. \"Premium increases have lagged cost increases significantly.\"\nWhether HMOs are able next year to restore profit margins to the levels that Wall Street likes may have as much to do with their willingness to court public criticism as with their actual market power, suggested one industry observer.\n\"This has been a year characterised by scathing attacks on the industry with the implication that profits are being made at the expense of high-quality health care,\" said Doug Sherlock, editor of the industry newsletter Pulse.\nWith one eye on public relations and the other on the bottom line, some HMOs in 1996 may have intentionally let margins slip, Sherlock suggested. \"One or 2 percent profit margins are less easy to attack than 9 percent,\" he said.\nIf the heat in state legislatures and elsewhere subsides, HMOs may feel they have room to move, or they may not, Sherlock said. \"These companies still have ... all the bargaining power they need. It's really a situation of whether they choose to exercise it or not.\"\nBased on a survey of 100 HMOs nationwide, Pulse projects the industry's aggregate medical-loss ratio to decline 1.5 percentage points next year, boosting profits slightly. The ratio, which measures how much HMOs pay out to cover members' medical costs, rose a hefty 4.2 percentage points in 1996.\nMore mergers and acquisitions are expected, as well. Of the more than 600 U.S. HMOs, only United and Aetna look to be truly national players, Hoehn said. \"Everybody else has to either merge with someone or sell,\" he said.",

The anticipated cuts would reduce that headcount by 5 percent to 9 percent, the company said.\nThe tax-free spin-off proposed would create a new firm by the end of 1997. Current Monsanto shareholders would keep their Monsanto shares and get shares in the new concern as a special dividend, the company said.\nMonsanto said its directors approved the spin-off.\nThe company also said the exact amount of the after-tax charge, which is to cover the costs of job reductions, asset and equipment write-offs, and consolidation of some manufacturing and offices, would be fixed at a later date.\nAnalysts estimated the one-time charge would total between 80 cents and $1 per share.\nMonsanto, which reported 1995 profits of $739 million, or $1.25 a share, is expected to post per-share profits for 1996 of $1.50, according to First Call, which tracks analysts' projections.\nMonsanto said in October it was considering options for its chemicals business, which had about $3 billion in 1995 revenues but is growing less rapidly than other units and is subject to more ups and downs.\n\"Chemicals would hurt the multiple of the company if they held onto it ... because the chemicals growth rate is not as high as the agriculturals growth rate and the earnings are more cyclical,\" said PaineWebber industry analyst Paul Raman.\nThe chemicals business -- making acrylic carpet fibers, plastic interlayers for glass, industrial phosphorus compounds and other products -- was shopped around for months, but no buyer was found, in part for tax reasons, analysts said.\nMonsanto said the spin-off requires shareholder approval and clearance by government agencies and the Internal Revenue Service for it to be tax-free.\nThe spin-off is intended to be completed no later than the end of next year. Until then, the two companies will operate separately within Monsanto beginning early next year, it said.\nMonsanto's stock slipped 37.5 cents to $40.75 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.",

The year-ago quarter included earnings of $5 million, or 1 cent a share, from discontined operations.\nSales grew 7 percent to $3.62 billion from $3.37 billion.\nThe results surpassed analysts' average forecasts of 93 cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.\n3M's stock jumped $2 to $73.25, helping to boost the Dow Jones industrial average, of which is it is a component.\n\"It's been a long time since 3M beat any kind of estimate,\" said PNC Institutional Investment Services analyst John Franck. \"A lot of people were questioning whether this company could grow again.\"\n3M served notice that it can grow with third-quarter sales up 7.5 percent and profits up 17.4 percent, analysts said.\n\"Now that they've spun off Imation, which was taking up too much of their resources and adding to earnings volatility, this is the 3M that most people expect when they invest in it,\" said Crowell Weedon analyst Douglas Christopher.\nOn July 1, 3M's data storage and imaging businesses began operations as an independent company, Imation Corp. The third quarter was 3M's first since the spinoff.\n\"They're not held back anymore by that business that's now called Imation,\" said Merrill Lynch analyst Robert Curran.\n3M said it expected solid growth again in the fourth quarter.\nIf it can deliver successive quarters of big gains, the company's stock could move out of the realm of value stock funds and draw the attention again of growth stock investors, analysts said.\n\"3M is a little different from most companies ... They're PhD oriented so there's a lot of intellectual types up there, but they're building a powerhouse,\" said Franck.\n3M makes thousands of products -- from Scotch tape, Post-it notes and air filters to diaper closures, flexible computer circuits and kitchen sponges.\n\"It can be said that their domestic business is something of an indicator of the economy as a whole because it's so diverse,\" said Merrill Lynch's Curran.\nThat portrayal is somewhat less accurate since the Imation spin-off, since key sectors of the economy are now absent from 3M's product line and more than half its business is outside the United States.\nStill, said Franck, \"You can probably take U.S. GDP (gross domestic product), multiply it by two and factor in whatever you want for inflation and you've basically got their sales growth rate ... If the economy is doing well, they do well.\"\nThe company's units in Japan, elsewhere in Asia, Latin America and Canada posted double-digit volume increases in the quarter while unit sales in Europe grew 7 percent, despite sluggish economies in many major European countries.\nFor the nine months, net income grew 6 percent to $1.14 billion, or $2.73 a share, as sales rose 4 percent to $10.61 billion.",

The fourth-quarter charges consist mainly of costs related to the transition to the next generation of digital products, restructuring costs incurred through Dec. 31, and the write-down of certain assets, the company said.\nThe company said it will incur additional charges this year of up to $70 million for costs related to the spin-off, including the costs of dividing the company's Taiwan assets between NextLevel Systems and General Semiconductor.\nThe company expects fourth-quarter earnings, which will be announced Feb. 10, to be in the range of 28 cents to 32 cents a share, excluding the charges. Last year, the company reported net earnings of $53.5 million, or 43 cents per share, in its fiscal fourth quarter.\nThe restructuring is expected to be completed this summer.\nFriedland, who will become chairman of NextLevel, said the three businesses would be best positioned as independent, public companies.\n\"The businesses have different dynamics and business cycles, serve different markets and customers, are subject to different competitive forces and must be managed with different short- and long-term goals,\" Friedland said in a statement.\nNextLevel will be comprised of General Instrument's cable, satellite and telephone businesses, which had 1996 sales of about $1.7 billion. The company will supply systems and components for high-performance networks delivering video, voice and Internet and data services.\nCommScope Inc. will make and supply coaxial and electronic cables, businesses that had 1996 sales of more than $560 million.\nGeneral Semiconductor Inc., the company's power semiconductor division, will supply low-to-medium power rectifiers and voltage suppressors. It had 1996 sales of more than $360 million.\nGeneral Instrument stock rose 12.5 cents to $22.875 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.",

        "Text": "Outboard Marine Corp said it is only five percent finished with a radical restructuring that it expects will result in more charges against earnings in 1997 and possibly in 1998, the company said.\nRestructuring is about \"five percent complete as far as going down the road and getting the savings,\" said spokesman Stan Main. \"That does not mean that we've taken only five percent of our restructuring charges ... There will likely be more charges during '97 and perhaps even into '98.\"\nShares in Outboard on Friday were off 1/4 to 15-3/4.  \nThe Waukegan, Ill.-based maker of boats and boat engines reported fourth-quarter profits Thursday that, excluding restructuring charges, beat Wall Street estimates.\nAnalysts cautioned, however, that a turnaround at Outboard remains a long-term project.\n\"They're going to be continuing this restructuring process in '97 and they're going to continue to have some more charges ... They describe the phase they're in now as the discovery process,\" said Lehman Brothers analyst Harriet Baldwin.\nA key moment could come Tuesday when Outboard executives are scheduled to meet with analysts and investors in New York.  \nExpected to be in attendance are the principals of Greenway Partners, an investment firm led by former Carl Icahn associates Alfred Kingsley and Gary Duberstein. Greenway bought an 8.5-percent stake in Outboard this summer.\nAlthough the firm is known for activism, Greenway so far has not pressured Outboard to alter course, Main said. Nor has there been further communication between Greenway and company executives since initial discussions in August, he said.\nAnalysts speculated there could be fireworks next week or at the January 16 annual meeting of shareholders, who are said to be growing impatient for a cohesive recovery plan.  \nA restructuring was set in motion this year by chief executive Harry Bowman, who came aboard in 1995, when the stock was trading in the low 20s. Bowman continues to deliberate over how to fix Outboard and key pieces remain to be put in place, analysts said.\nThe business is under evaluation from top to bottom, Main said. Once restructuring is complete, Outboard \"certainly will be a marine products company,\" he said.  \n\"Longer term, we could get into products that would not be marine related. But our initial focus over the next two to three years is to fix the business that we're in and then perhaps look at other areas that might be less cyclical or seasonal,\" said Main, who is director of strategic planning.\nBowman has spoken of finding more stability for Outboard, which suffers more from boating's boom-bust cycles than rivals, such as Lake Forest, Ill.-based Brunswick Corp, which has diversified into bowling, fishing and camping gear.\nOutboard sees opportunities to enter other markets -- such as motorcycles, snowmobiles and personal watercraft -- via its innovative FICHT fuel injection engine technology, Main said.\nSpending on capital and tooling in fiscal 1996, ended September 30, fell to $52.7 million from $66.5 million the year before, but spending on FICHT is holding steady as the company converts more of its engine line to it, he said.\nSales of 150-hp FICHT engines to dealers will begin in December and consumers will see the engines in January. A promotional roll-out is underway.\nThe company plans to convert its entire outboard engine line above 20-hp to FICHT engines, which will cost 22 to 25 percent more than their traditional equivalents, Main said.",

Not only Lens, headed by Robert Monks, but billionaire George Soros and others are among WMX shareholders demanding changes.\nThe company has responded by repurchasing shares and selling off pieces of its Rust International unit, its stake in Wessex Water Plc and most of its medical waste business. The sales have raised about $1 billion in cash.\nYet WMX's stock price has hardly budged, prompting the activist stakeholders to press harder still for management changes, new directors and more asset sales, analysts said.  \n\"Management has been moving in this direction and the stock price has responded moderately, but I don't think to anywhere near the level that investors want,\" Mannis said.\nShares in WMX were off 1/4 at 33-1/2 late Monday, compared to a 24-month high above $36 in early December. A year ago, they were trading in the $30 per share range.\n\"Between now and the annual meeting (May 9), management has its opportunity to once and for all...show the Street its plan for enhancing shareholder value. If they don't do that, I think investors are going to look at some of the proposals Lens is making,\" Mannis said.  \nSoros Fund Management owns 19.7 million shares of WMX, or nearly four percent of the company, according to CDA/Spectrum.\nLens's stake is reportedly much smaller than Soros's.\nThe latest proposal from Lens on selling non-core assets contains little new, WMX spokesman Bill Plunkett said.\n\"The proposal is consistent with the things the company is already aggressively pursuing, essentially affirming our strategy,\" Plunkett said. \"We have other equity investments remaining. We have other businesses that are non-core and we have under-performing businesses.... We have been working with various financial advisers to enhance shareholder value.\"\nCredit Suisse First Boston industry analyst Michael Hoffman said WMX on its own will likely fulfill Soros's and Lens's agenda. \"These guys would just like it to happen faster,\" Hoffman said. WMX has \"done a lot of the easier things. Now it gets a little more challenging.\"\nAn obvious next step for the company would be to authorize more share buybacks, Mannis said.\nWMX could still sell off certain non-U.S. interests, as well as its equity interest in ServiceMaster LP, analysts said. Whether such steps are taken before the annual meeting remains to be seen, but in the meantime, Lens and Soros can be expected to keep the pressure on.\n\"This is just another volley in the skirmish,\" said Smith Barney industry analyst Leone Young.\nWMX is scheduled to report fourth-quarter financial results in the week of February 3.",

        "Text": "Increasing pressure from customers to hold down prices will keep a profit squeeze on U.S. medical device manufacturers in 1997, although the sector's biggest firms are expected to show healthy growth.\nOther variables looming over the industry are the naming of a successor to departing U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler and Congress' mood on healthcare.\n\"Expectations are still for a positive environment from a Washington standpoint, but I don't think you can take that for granted,\" said Prudential Securities analyst Charlene Lu.  \nAfter six contentious years, Kessler announced his resignation from the FDA last month. The White House has not named a replacement. \"Questions like who replaces Kessler are going to have a big impact on whether new products get approved quickly,\" Lu said.\nCongressional and White House sentiment on reforming the U.S. healthcare industry is lukewarm at the moment, but could reemerge as an issue, analysts said.\n\"Meanwhile, managed care marches on and that will have an impact,\" said Wasserstein Perella analyst Robert Dunne.  \nHealth maintenance organizations, hospitals and others that buy medical devices -- such as pacemakers, catheters and heart valves -- are squeezing device makers for lower prices. That has cut into profits and limited the growth potential of some companies, analysts said.\n\"You're going to continue to see greater and greater market pressures,\" Lu said.\nIn search of growth, many device companies are looking overseas and finding opportunity. \"To grow the top line, you've got to move outside the United States,\" said Dain Bosworth analyst Rachael Scherer.  \nPartly as a result, the sector's biggest firms -- those with global reach -- had the best 1996 and are widely expected to lead the pack again next year. Companies such as Medtronic Inc, Boston Scientific Corp and Guidant Corp are widely seen as market outperformers for 1997.\n\"I'm looking probably for 20 percent-plus earnings growth from them ... Those stocks will probably perform a little bit better than the market,\" Dunne said.  \nPossibly less rosy is the general outlook for small device companies. Scherer pointed out that Nasdaq medical technology stocks severely underperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index this year, while larger listed issues topped the index, mirroring a dichotomy seen in other industries, as well.\n\"We're optimistic that Nasdaq med tech issues will outperform next year,\" Scherer said.\nSmaller and mid-sized firms named by analysts as potential 1997 winners were Datascope Corp, Target Therapeutics Inc, Stryker Corp, Mentor Corp, and Nellcor Puritan Bennett Inc.\nOn the technology front, growth was expected to continue to be strong for stents, which shore up the insides of diseased blood vessels, and implantable defibrillators, which treat too-rapid heartbeat.\nKey products expected next year from industry giant Medtronic include an atrial fibrillation device, a device for continually recording electrocardiogram readouts to help diagnose unexpected fainting, a new stent and an implantable drug pump for cancer patients, Medtronic said.",

Telecommunications analysts forecast Optus to deliver a profit before abnormals of between A$55 million and A$65 million.\n\"I don't think the market will be disappointed,\" said one Sydney-based analyst. \"I think the revenue is a little bit down on what they were talking about.\"\nThe results reflected strong revenue growth of 36 percent to A$1.94 billion in 1995/96, with high revenue increases from its three main businesses of mobile telephones, long-distance calls and services to the corporate and government sector, chief operating officer Phil Jacobs said on Wednesday.\nOptus, 24.5 percent owned each by U.S. BellSouth Corp and Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc, said in February it expected to achieve A$2.0 billion in revenue in 1995/96.\nThe Sydney-based group is still expected to make its sharemarket debut by the end of 1996, Switkowski said.\n\"The float's planned to occur this side of Christmas and the prospectus is progressing to plan, but it is not done,\" he told reporters after the results anouncement.\nThe float is expected to raise around A$1.5 billion, making it the largest telecommunications company to list on the Australian Stock Exchange, with up to 40 percent of the company shares to be listed.\nOptus will later be joined by Telstra on the stock exchange.\nThe Australian government plans to raise A$8.0 billion from the sale of one-third of Telstra in 1997/98, which will be just after full deregulation of Australia's telecommunications industry on July 11, 1997.\nDespite chalking up its first annual profit, Optus incurred increased losses from its 46.5 percent-owned pay television and local telephone call operator Optus Vision.\nOptus said its share of losses from Optus Vision was A$74.0 million, which were mainly due to the start-up of the offshoot, which is spending A$3.0 billion rolling out its nationwide fibre optic cable network to provide pay TV and telephone services.\nOptus Vision, which includes Australia's richest man Kerry Packer amongst its shareholders, reported a loss of A$1.54 million in 1994/95, in its first year of operation. The company has not announced its 1995/96 results.\nSwitkowski was coy about 1996/97 forecasts. Optus Communications was completing its prospectus for the sharemarket float, which would contain revenue and profit forecasts.\nHowever, Switkowski predicted that revenue from its mobile telephone business would exceed revenues from its long-distance calls due to strong local demand, as Australia has one of the highest penetration rates for mobile phones in the world.",

        "Text": "The growth of the Internet has created the biggest creative explosion in the history of the computing world, said Sun Microsystems Inc chairman Scott McNealy on Friday.\n\"It is only been since we unleashed the Internet that you have suddenly seen this unleashing of technology and innovation and research and a transformation,\" McNealy told Reuters in an interview.\nMcNealy cited the launch of the Netscape Communications Corp Navigation browser and his company's Java computer language that allows users to operate across all computer operating systems as examples of recent computer innovation.\nThe Internet and Java is likely to pose the biggest threat to U.S. software giant Microsoft, said McNealy, who is on a 10-day visit to Australian and New Zealand along with 2,500 Sun employees, who are in Sydney attending a sales convention.\n\"Its two main two sources of revenue, (Microsoft) Office (software) and the desktop operating system are under threat,\" said McNealy, who is well known for firing salvos at Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder.\nMicrosoft and Sun are locked in many battles across the fiercely competitive computer industry. Microsoft has annual revenues around US$8.6 billion, while Sun has revenues of US$7.00 billion a year.\nMcNealy said Java users could operate in all operating systems including Windows, while the Internet and Java allowed users to download word processing applications without buying Microsoft's popular Microsoft Office software.\n\"The Internet has forced them (Microsoft) to change their strategies,\" said the 42-year-old computer millionaire.\nMicrosoft unveiled plans on Thursday to relaunch its online service Microsoft Network (MSN) with a US$100 million promotion push in order to double MSN's subscriber base. But McNealy said this showed another Internet strategy shift by Microsoft.\n\"Do you know what the Internet has done to our business? Absolutely nothing, we haven't changed our strategy one bit,\" said McNealy, who is on his first visit to Australia.\nJava, which was developed by Sun and launched in May 1995, is a language that specialises in letting a wide range of computers share information with each other through networks.\nThose capabilities are in themselves a threat to dominant players like Microsoft, whose MS-DOS and family of Windows operating systems run on nearly 90 percent of the world's PCs, industry sources said.\nSun has already licenced its Java technology to most of the world's computer industry, including Microsoft.\nMcNealy sees no threat from selling Sun's Java technology to its competitors. \"We don't own the language, we compete by doing something better in the language. It is like trying to own the English language, you compete by what you do with the language.\"\nJava computers, known as Network Computers, would be launched soon, which McNealy likened to the launch of the car. The Network Computer is the third wave in the evolution of the computer, McNealy said. The first was the mainframe, with the second wave being the personal computer, he said.\n\"We will still have buses and trains, which work on centralised systems like the mainframe. We will still have bicycles, which are like PCs, but the preferred mode of transportation for most of us is the automobile, which will be the Network Computer,\" McNealy said.",

He said Holyman had looked at particular routes within China and Indonesia, but they did not fit within the company's plans. \"I would imagine in a few years we would have something up there (in Asia),\" Lennon said.\nHolyman shares had a lacklustre showing in its first year of listing, but since January this year the shares have more than doubled to make the stock one of the strongest sharemarket performers over the past year.\nThe shares listed in April 1994 at A$2.00 and hit a high of A$6.00 on November 11 and are currently trading around A$5.06.  \nThe Sydney-based group was floated on the local bourse in April 1994, as part of a spin-off from TNT Ltd, when the transport group was selling assets to trim its high debts.\n\"The stock really took some time to get off the ground,\" Butcher said.\n\"I think there has been a lot of hard work done over the past year to educate shareholders in what the company is doing and where the company is going as there was a perception out there that we were a mismash of businesses,\" Butcher said.  \nHolyman's main activities are its fast ferry services in Australia, across the North Sea between Britain and Europe, New York and in Denmark. It also operates a gas pipeline, bulk commodity handling and freight forwarding businesses.\n\"There are a number of different projects and businesses, we found there are quite a lot of common threads going through,\" Butcher said. \"I think these operations all have their own place and there are opportunties to expand these further,\" he said.\nButcher worked with TNT for 25 years before taking charge of Holyman when it split from TNT.  \nButcher said the group had no plans to raise capital to fund the expected expansion, as the company was well financed.\nIn October, Holyman bought a fast passenger ferry for A$43 million. He said there was no plans for any immediate purchases of more ferries.\nButcher said he could not comment on its trading performance or earnings forecasts.\nHolyman reported a net profit of A$16.09 million in calendar 1995. The group posted a net profit of A$15.03 million in the six months to June 30, 1996, up from A$6.79 million earlier.",

PNG's Porgera mine is expected to produce over 940,000 ounces of gold in calendar 1996.\n\"It (the takeover) recognises the prospectivity that we see of the Asia-Pacific region and our desire to take full advantage of any opportunities that exist here,\" said Placer Dome's chief executive officer John Willson.\nHowever, there were no plans to acquire more assets in the Asia-Pacific region, he said. However, Placer Pacific has stepped up its exploration activity in Asia in recent years with programmes in China, Indonesia and the Philippines.\nThe takeover bids were well received by investors on the Australian share market, with both Highlands and Placer Pacific shares soaring in active trade on the bid announcements, which were made before Thursday's market open.\nHowever, the bids were not so welcomed by Highlands, which said Placer Dome's offer of 75 cents (US$0.61) for each Highlands shares was inadequate. However, Placer Pacific was more coy, it advised shareholders to take no action on the bid.\nThe Sydney-based Placer Pacific was partly floated in 1986 by its parent, which in turn now plans to buy-out the rest of the 24.6 percent it does not own through a share swap of one Placer Dome share for every 15 Placer Pacific shares.\nPlacer Dome, a Vancouver-based miner and one of the world's top three gold producers, plans to finance its A$425 million Highlands purchase through the issue of prefered shares.\n\"When we are done with this acquisition assuming it goes ahead, we will have debt of about US$1.0 billion and equity of US$1.7 billion,\" Willson said\n\"We will then refinance the Highlands gold purchase through a preferred share issue and we look at asset sales to bring our equity close to US$2.0 billion and with debt below $1.0 billion, we will be well within our range on a debt-to-equity basis.\"\nHighlands has stakes in two potentially large mining projects in PNG. The Nena/Frieda River copper/gold project and the Ramu nickel-cobalt deposit, both projects are estimated to cost a total of US$1.5 billion to develop.\nIn regards to Highlands non-gold assets, Willson said: \"We don't know much about them or what we are going to do with them, to develop them, sell them, or swap them.\"\nAustralian gold analysts said the Canadian gold miner was likely to succeed with its two bids. \"I think they will walk it in,\" said David Kauler, gold mining analyst at ANZ Securities.\nAnalysts said the offers are probably opportunistic, given that Placer Pacific and Highlands share prices were both earlier this year above Placer Dome's offer prices. But both have fallen with the gold price, which is currently around 2-1/2 year lows.\nHighlands shares closed 17 cents or 29 percent higher at 75 cents, Placer Dome has amassed a 33 percent stake in Highlands over the past two days. Placer Pacific shares closed 42 cents or 29.37 percent higher at A$1.85 with 5.5 million shares traded.",

In 1994 Packer led a consortium to bid for the 12-year Sydney casino licence, but lost out to the Showboat led consortium in December 1994.\nSince losing the Sydney casino license bid, Packer interests have launched several legal actions against Showboat for the award of the licence by the New South Wales (NSW) government.  \nPacker's punt on SHC shares have already made him a profit as shares in both the casino owner and PBL rose strongly after the deal was announced before Monday's sharemarket open.\nIn early afternoon trade, SHC shares were at a record high of A$2.27, a 34 cent or 17.61 percent rise in active trade, while PBL shares were 25 cents higher at A$6.35.\nThe deal was good for both companies as Packer's influence was likely to yield a tax-concession for the casino on the high-roller market, which is seen boosting cash flow for both the casino and PBL, Australian market analysts said.  \nSHC owns the only legal casino in Sydney and has battled the New South Wales state government for the past 16 months to get a similar tax rate to other Australian casinos.\n\"I think Packer will probably get the tax-break from the government,\" one Sydney-based casino analyst said. \"I expect there will be some tax-break announcement this month,\" he said.\nThe Sydney casino is seeking a 10 percent tax concession from the state government on big spending gamblers, mainly from Asia, compared with the present tax rate of 27 percent.  \nPBL is also expected to end the disappointing run of operating results the casino has reported since it opened a temporary casino in September 1995. The casino is expected to open a A$1.0 billion permanment casino later this year.\nPacker also has a 10 percent stake in Melbourne casino operator Crown Ltd and about 20 percent of Hudson Conway Ltd, which in turn owns 37 percent of Crown.\n\"Given the Packer-Hudson Conway type of relationship it looks like there is a bit more to come out of this one,\" said Richard Wolf, a casino analyst at Bell Securities.",

        "Text": "British Airways Plc (BA) said on Tuesday that it had no plans for new alliances over the next few years, but would extend its global reach by franchising its popular brand name to smaller airlines.\nBritish Airways has an alliance with Australian carrier Qantas Airways Ltd and formed an alliance with American Airlines in June, although this is subject to regulatory approvals and a legal suit by USAir Group, in which BA holds 24.6 percent.\n\"One of the great challenges of alliance development is the management challenge and I think it would be unwise to take on any more than we can absorb at any one time,\" BA chief executive Robert Ayling said at an industry luncheon in Sydney.\nReports that BA would look to an alliance with a Japanese airline, notably Japan Airlines, were quashed by Ayling in a speech to the National Aviation Press Club in Sydney.\n\"I think the Japanese airline industry is an independent industry and I think it will remain a strongly independent industry. If there are opportunities in the future for developing relationships there with other carriers then obviously we will do that,\" Ayling said.  \nHowever, Ayling said the airline's four-year experiment with franchising its brand name to smaller airlines was successful and would be an area of future growth, providing safety and customer service standards were met.\n\"It is a way of bringing extended services to customers and of allowing operators of smaller airlines, who would have found it very difficult to survive in this world of global networks, to be more successful,\" Ayling said.\nIn June, BA signed its first franchise agreement outside of the European Union with South Africa's largest independent carrier, Comair. Under the deal Comair's eight-jet fleet will use the British Airways name and livery.\nUnder the existing rules it would have been impossible to acquire or invest more than 50 percent in an airline in South Africa, said Ayling. \"South Africa is a part of the world which would not be open to us if we didn't have this deal,\" he said.\nAyling is visiting Australia to look at the operations of BA's 25 percent stake in Qantas, the national carrier.\nUnder the alliances with American Airlines and Qantas, BA and its partners fly to over 500 destinations in about 100 countries. Ayling said BA's global alliance could lead to opportunities in other parts of the world.  \n\"We may see, although this may be some way off, fleet acquisition opportunities, which would make a significant impact on procurement of aircraft,\" said Ayling.\n\"Once these agreements are put in place and they are being effectively managed, we will be able to see some things we are not able to see at the moment,\" he said.\nTwo weeks ago, BA reported an 11.1 percent rise in first quarter profits to 150 million sterling (US$231 million) on sales of 2.103 billion sterling. It forecast another record year in the year to March 1997.",

The issue would proceed upon completion of the acquisition, expected to in April.  \nSt George said the merger was driven by the need to lower costs and a review had found the merger could achieve a reduction of 15 percent in annual combined expenses or A$140 million before tax.\nAdvance shares soared over 10 percent on the announcement.\nAnalysts said that although there would be cost savings, the price was still fairly generous.\n\"My initial reaction is that it looks like Advance Bank shareholders are coming out of the deal quite well, whereas St George shareholders are coming out not so well,\" said one Sydney-based banking analyst.  \n\"It's a big price. I can't imagine anybody else coming and topping the price St George is offering,\" said BNP's Lyon.\nAnalysts said the offer valued Advance at 2.8 times net asset backing, well above the 2.0 times asset backing level at which recent Australian bank merger prices had been based.\nSt George has been desperate to have a friendly merger as it is seen as a takeover target itself.\nAustralia's largest banking group, National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB), holds a 6.8 percent stake in St George.\nNAB has said it has no takeover plans for St George.  \nAnalysts said the Wallis inquiry into Australia's finance and banking sector might put NAB's acquisition plans on hold until the inquiry reported its findings in March.\nSt George's bid for Metway Bank Ltd earlier this year was scuttled by the Queensland government, which trumped its offer with a higher bid through its wholly-owned financial services group Suncorp and the Queensland Industry and Development Corp (QIDC). Last year, St George was foiled in its merger bid for Perth-based Challenge Bank Ltd when Westpac Banking Corp made a higher offer.  \nSt George was also in talks last year to merge with the Bank of Western Australia Ltd, before the Bank of Scotalnd Ltd took control, and the Bank of South Australia, which was takeover by Advance early 1995.\nSt George shares plunged after the announcement.\nAt 2.20 p.m. (0420 GMT) Advance Bank shares were 69 cents or 10.99 percent higher at A$6.97 while St George shares were 40 cents or 4.47 percent down at A$8.55.",

However, Black repeated that he would sell his Fairfax stake if he was not allowed to raise it further.  \n\"If the road is truly blocked, then obviously we are going,\" Black said. He added that Hollinger would not lodge any application for a higher stake until the government ended its study into media ownership and presented new ownership rules.\nUnder Australia's current media ownership rules, foreigners are prevented from owning more than 25 percent of a newspaper group or 15 percent of a television group. They also prevent a newspaper group owner from owning more than 15 percent of a television station in the same city and vice-versa. \"These thing as they are now are very anachronistic,\" Black told reporters.  \nIn August, Packer's main media group, Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd (PBL) proposed a merger between PBL and Fairfax only if media ownership rules were liberalised. PBL owns top-rating Nine Network and 15 percent of Fairfax.\nBlack said PBL's merger proposal was unlikely to succeed while he (Black) was a shareholder. \"He (Packer) would have quite a time getting that one through,\" Black said.\n\"I don't ever rule out anything, but I think that's fairly improbable. If Mr Packer wants to control Fairfax he's going to have to it the old-fashioned way and pay for it.\" Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd owns five percent of Fairfax.  \n\"I know he's averse to doing that,\" Black said. He added he was not particularly interested in any stock swap deal with Packer which would leave him with a PBL stake.\nBlack said John Fairfax's profits were starting to improve.\nFairfax reported a 41 percent fall in net profit to A$87.4 million in the year to June 30, 1996.\n\"It's starting to look a little better now. Profits are affected by increased newsprint, they are affected by increased depreciation because of the plant at Chullora, cash flow rates are starting to improve a little bit,\" Black said. Fairfax spent A$330 million on a new printing plant at Chullora in Sydney.  \nFairfax chairman Sir Laurence Street told shareholders the slower Australian economy coupled with higher newsprint prices would impact on the group's final results for the 1996/97 year.\n\"Coupled with the state of the economy, Fairfax, in common with the whole newspaper industry, has had to face high newsprint prices and this, too, will impact upon our final results in the current year,\" Street said.\nAt 3.45 p.m. (0435 GMT) Fairfax shares were two cents higher at A$2.69, giving it a market capitalisation of A$2.04 billion.",

The stock closed 18 cents or 2.52 percent lower at A$6.95 with over 4.7 million shares traded.\nThe weaker profit was a result of poorer returns in U.S. TV, Australian newspapers and book publishing, News Corp said.\n\"This is not as people were expecting type of result. It was a very flat result,\" one Sydney-based media analyst said.\nNews Corp could still report a 20 percent rise in net profits for the 1996/97 year as it was only the U.S. television business that was clearly below forecast, analysts' said. They said this forecast by Murdoch was in U.S. dollar terms.\nIn U.S. dollar terms, News Corp operating income was seven percent higher in the first quarter.\n\"Basically, what News has said is 'the first quarter was a bit disappointing but you are still going to get your growth for the year',\" one Melbourne-based analysts said after taking part in an analysts' conference telephone call with News Corp.\nNews Corp said its profit was mainly bolstered by the worldwide box office success of the science fiction movie Independence Day and its British newspapers and book publishing.\nIndependence Day, a film about invading aliens who launch an attack against the Earth from huge space ships, has grossed more than US$670 million worldwide, making it the third highest-grossing film in box office history.\nBritish newspaper operations enjoyed strong growth with an 18-percent gain in operating profits in the three months to September, News Corp said. The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times newspapers all posted gains in both advertising and circulation revenues in the first quarter.\n\"Additionally, the group has benefitted from reduced newsprint costs,\" the company said.\n\"Offsetting these gains were weaker results in U.S. television, Australian newspapers and book publishing, which lacked results from the educational division which was sold in March 1996,\" it said.\nNews also said continued losses for its Asian satellite broadcaster, STAR TV, were in line with expectations.\nThe fall in profit in Australian dollar terms also reflected the stronger local currency against the U.S. dollar as about 75 percent of News Corp's revenue is in U.S. dollars.\nThe first quarter profit drop follows a profit dip for News Corp in the 1995/96 year, when it reported a six-percent fall in pre-abnormals net profit to A$1.26 billion.",

But he said BT was well placed to fight competition at home and abroad.\n\"They are the group that has done the best (abroad) so far and in the UK, they have protected their position,\" he said.\nBrace said BT planned to \"get very aggressive\" in the next two years as European telecoms markets are opened around 1998.\nBT expects to win more than 30 percent of revenues from its six continental European joint ventures after liberalisation.

Since privatisation in 1984, about 110,000 jobs have gone. Another 3,200 staff left in the first half of this year with about 3,000 more voluntary redundancies expected this year.\nAsked whether BT planned similar deals to its $20 billion MCI merger, Brace said: \"I'm not sure that there are similar deals as MCI -- because there aren't many companies that size in the world one would wish to merge with,\" he said.",

(Selling) would be our normal procedure,\" said a spokesman.\nIn normal circumstances, a firm recommends even a hostile offer after the bid has been declared unconditional.\nBut there has been little about CE Electric's fight for Northern that has been normal -- and at least one institution admitted to harbouring a slim hope Northern could still pull something out of the hat.\nNorthern Electric, which last year became the only one of the 12 regional electricity companies (RECs) to fight off a hostile bid, lost the battle after an unprecendented extension to the bid tipped the votes in CE Electric's favour.\nThe Prudential Corp, one of Northern's biggest shareholders, then attempted to defeat the takeover in the eleventh hour by trying to persuade investors who had accepted the offer to sell their Northern shares to the insurer instead for the same price.\nCE Electric is keen to win at least 90 percent of the shares -- the amount needed under British takeover rules before it can carry out a compulsory purchase of the remaining ones -- and its message to any institutions thinking about hanging on to minority stakes was terse.\n\"If these reports about some shareholders deciding that they will not accept the offer are true, it raises a number of questions about their investment policy. But obviously it is up to them to decide what they want to do,\" a CalEnergy spokesman.\nWhile Northern's core business is heavily regulated, most institutions invest in utilities for their robust dividends -- which is a matter for the board, not the industry regulator.\nSome institutions said they remained baffled that Northern's bid for independence had failed because of a technicality.\nThe Takeover Panel last Friday extended the bid, after CE Electric narrowly failed to win control, because Northern's broker BZW had belatedly reported it had charged Northern an extra 250,000 pounds in a performance-related fee.\nOne institution said on Friday it remained convined that Northern was worth 700-720 pence a share, saying that if CE's bid had failed, the U.S. group may have come back to discuss a higher price -- or a fresh bidder could have been attracted.\nFailing that, the value of the company would have been reflected in its share price in the long term, it said.\nOnly two of 12 regional electricity companies now remain independent -- Southern Electric and Yorkshire Electricity. Six have been bid for by American companies.",

        "Text": "British Telecommunications admitted on Thursday to not sharing the same culture as its merger partner MCI Communications, America's second largest international carrier.\nBut after reporting robust third quarter profits, helped by \"healthy\" demand for its products and services, BT's chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield told reporters, \"We are open minded that these things (mergers) have their pitfalls on culture.\"\nCommentators have dubbed BT \"staid\" and MCI \"spunky\". But Bonfield said MCI staff he had met so far had been \"amazingly enthusiastic\" about the two companies' planned $20 billion merger, which BT expects European and American regulators to clear by this autumn.\nAfter a 39 million pound ($64 million) charge for redundancies, BT's third quarter pretax profits rose to 909 million pounds ($1.45 billion) from 829 million pounds last time -- towards the upper end of analysts expectations.\nBT announced last October that it planned to buy the 80 percent of MCI that it did not already own. The new group, called Concert Plc, aims to service multinational companies end-to-end and be represented in all the world's key nations.\nBT also hopes to become the second telecoms operator in continental Europe as key markets are eased open to competition in 1998 and is itching to get into lucrative Asian markets.\nBT has one of the most comprehensive network partnerships across Europe, having set up joint ventures in about eight continental European markets worth more than $140 billion.\nIn a move to boost its German venture, BT announced that Norwegian telecoms operator Telenor had agreed in principle to take a 10 percent stake in VIAG InterKom, the alliance BT has set up with German engineering conglomerate VIAG AG.\nTelenor brings with it vital expertise from operating in one of the world's most saturated markets for mobile telephones. Having won a mobile and fixed-line licence in Germany, BT said VIAG InterKom would be the first major telecoms copany to exploit the convergence between the two services.\nIn December, BT beat arch-rivals Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom by clinching a deal with TeleDanmark in Switzerland's second telecom network Newtelco.\nWhile global telecoms groups jockey for position in a race to secure lucrative services to multinational companies, Japan is seen as the last major frontier.\nBT has been wooing Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, the world's biggest telecoms titan, for years.\nWhile NTT takes its time to decide how best to enter the international market, BT's finance director Robert Brace told Reuters that the group did not expect an MCI-type deal in the Asian telecoms markets \"in the next few years\".\n\"I think we will continue to develop on a global basis as and when the opportunities arrive,\" he said.\nBonfield, who was in Japan last week, said NTT was too big a company to risk linking up with a single company.\n\"But it may come up with a preferred partner -- and we would like to be that partner,\" he said. BT, which already has a technology agreement with NTT, is keen to use the $150 billion group's lines to sell its Concert services to business clients.\nBT's share price, which has surged to new year highs of 450p in the run-up to results, seesawed despite what SocGen's analyst John Tysoe called \"a good, cheerful presentation\".\nTysoe has edged up his full year forecast to a pretax profit of 3.2 billion pounds, largely because of a 50 million pound reduction in the level of expected redundancy charges.\nBT saw net cash inflow swell to 4.4 billion pounds in the first nine months and has now got a hefty 211 million pounds of funds on its balance sheet.",

With BT keen to take on the U.S., the world's largest telecoms market -- worth about $200 billion -- regulators are keen to ensure that the same competitive benefits are available to U.S. companies.\nBT welcomed its new rivals, adding that it was hopeful of winning approval for its U.S. mega-merger. \"This (move) indicates how open the UK market is,\" a spokesman said.\nAnalysts say that expectations of growing competition and the inevitable falling margins at home have already been discounted in telecom companies' share prices.\n\"This has been very well flagged,\" noted one.\nMobile telephone operator Vodafone Group, having clinched its licence, jumped 6.5 pence to 246.5p.\nBT's shares rose four pence to 397p and Cable and Wireless' stock added 1/2p 474.5 pence by early afternoon.\nAnalysts have found it hard to predict how hard revenues will be hit by BT and Mercury's loss of market share as telecoms companies turn their attention overseas to help boost earnings.\nBut Cable and Wireless' Mercury is expected to suffer more than BT because international traffic makes up a much higher proportion of traffic -- and thus contributes a higher proportion of profits.",

BT had been keen to forge that deal because it would have given it access to the lucrative Asian telecoms market -- the world's fastest growing market.\nAnalysts now expect BT and MCI to start making overtures to major Asian players such as Japan's giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, the world's largest telecoms group. The company said in a statement that the proposed deal would create a world leading communications power house with annual cash flow of about 7.5 billion pounds.\nBT expects the merger would yield savings from combining overlapping services of 1.5 billion pounds ($2.46 billion) over the first five years and 500 million pounds per year before tax after that.\nBT also forecast dividends of 19.85 pence per share for the year to March 31, 1997 -- a rise of six percent over last year -- excluding the 35p per share special dividend.\nBT, which will release full year results on November 14, has declared a half year dividend of 7.90 pence payable in November, six percent more than in the same period last year.\nThe deal is believed to be the second largest ever involving a U.S. company -- topped only by the 1989 buyout of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co.\nAnalysts said a combined company would be a good fit in the ultra-competitive U.S. long-distance phone industry, where MCI's major competitors are AT&T Corp and Sprint.\nCurrent market leader AT&T, which would be the hardest hit by a fiancially muscular new enlarged rival, said on Friday it was confident any MCI/BT deal would receive proper scrutiny by the U.S. government.",

The group earlier raised pretax profits in the half year by 23 percent to 23.7 million pounds on revenues of 129.5 million pounds -- a 10 percent rise.  \nLomax said he saw the possibility of \"creating quite a bit of shareholder value\" by buying regional software companies, particularly in the banking industry.\nMisys, whose banking division alone now supplies software to 12,000 banks and 4,000 installations, has become one of the world's largest application software companies as consolidation in the industry gathers pace.\nIn the last 12 months, its shares have almost doubled to 1115 pence from 567 pence as it systematically targets international financial institutions that need new software at lower costs but with a greater security of transactions.  \nLomax insists that he is unworried by the share price, which at about 20 times prospective earnings, no longer looks cheap. Competitors' PE ratios are comparable, he says.\nBut the stock slipped 2.5p to 1115p despite record results.\nThe company has bought software businesses in risk management, private banking, corporate electronic banking, derivatives trading, capital markets trading --- areas where banks and securities firms want to expand and control their activities.\n\"Internal production is not meeting the time to market requirements that these companies have -- so they tend to look outside to other (software) products,\" Lomax says.\nOnly last month, Misys announced the planned $60 million acquistion of Summit Systems, a New York computer company specialising in financial derivatives trading software.\nIn terms of international banking, Misys is three to five times bigger than its next competitor.

But he added: \"For the right mix of partners, I think they could go below 50 percent -- but still maintain a very large strategic and influential interest in the company.\"\nEnergis has been burning a 100 million pound ($168 million) per-year hole in the pocket of the Grid, which was demerged from the 12 regional electricity companies and floated in 1995.\nSome analysts say that a significant equity partner in loss-making Energis, that has been valued at more than 600 million pounds, could help inspire the Grid's lacklustre shares.\nHowever, Grabiner said talks with U.S. telecoms giant AT&T were \"not very active\". Some analysts tip the Global One alliance between America's Sprint, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom as a potential partner.\nGlobal One has little British access and Energis has already signed a \"correspondent agreement\" with Sprint, America's third international carrier, to end each other's transatlantic calls.\nBut Energis is keeping its options open. It has also talked to \"selected international strategic investors\". \"(A partner) hasn't got to be a global carrier. It has to be a partner who can support us and add value to the business,\" Grabiner stated.\nEnergis was set up in 1993 and operates one of the country's most advanced networks by wrapping 4,500 kms of fibre optic cables -- capable of transmitting images and data as well as voice -- around the earthwires between overhead power pylons.\nBut Energis still has to rely on local operators to originate and end calls.\nA five billion pound merger between Cable and Wireless's Mercury unit, NYNEX CableComms, Bell Cablemedia and Videotron to create the country's biggest cable group has increased the pressure on Energis to get local access.\nTo be competitive with BT and Cable and Wireless Communications, Energis is considering linking up with other cable players, local operators or building its own network.\nIn the meantime, with an international licence safely under its belt, Energis is looking to spark an aggressive price war on European busines telephone routes with an \"imminent\" new correspondent agreement with a major telecom player.\nThe government broke the BT/Mercury duopoly on owning international calls networks last month, awarding 44 new international licences. Rivals, which used to be forced to lease line capacity from BT and Mercury at high prices, can now buy permament line capacity from others -- and save a lot of money.\n\"We have a very small market share, a dramatically reduced cost base and every incentive to be aggressive on price to grow our market share. And we will do that,\" Grabiner said.\nLast October, Energis offered to undercut BT by about 50 percent with a 10 pence-per-minute charge for selected business customers on direct dialled calls to America. \"European prices have further to go than North American prices,\" Grabiner noted.",

But he brings with him useful experience in television from a stint on the board of satellite broadcaster BSkyB.\nC&W, is mainly a telecommunications business and has little previous experience in television.\nBut one analyst gave the appointment a lukewarm reception.\n\"It's not an obvious choice,\" said the analyst. \"He strikes me as very competent, but does he know anything about the cable business? I'm not quite sure why they didn't go for one of the insiders. There were some strong people, I thought.\"\nAlthough C&W's shares were languishing 2.5 pence lower at 485.5 pence in late afternoon trade, NYNEX CableComms saw its shares rise 5.5 pence to 108.5 pence.\nWith C&W, Britain's second biggest telecoms company, planning to finalise the cable merger in spring, the lack of a chief executive at the new company had fuelled some speculation that a clash of cultures was hindering talks.\nAlthough Brown conceded that the merger was complicated, he insisted: \"That is not true...There's a great deal of activity and we really are right on track.\n\"There is an exciting spirit of cooperation to bring this to reality,\" he said.\nBrown, who will take the chair of the company, tipped to be worth 5.0 billion pounds ($8.36 billion), said a finance director would be the next announcement.\nThe proposed cable merger was announced last October -- and most such deals spell job cuts.\nAlthough Brown said he was not legally allowed to comment ahead of Cable and Wireless Communications's planned listing in London and New York, he warned that the new group would \"clearly\" reap efficiencies.\n\"I cannot quantify what that is going to be, but we are working on that and we will achieve that,\" he said.\nCable and Wireless Communications, which will be well-placed to compete against dominant telecoms company British Telecommunications, will provide local, national and international data and mobile telecommunications with multi-channel television and Internet services.",

The group raised pretax profits in the half year by 23 percent to 23.7 million pounds on revenues of 129.5 million pounds -- 10 percent higher than in the last half year.\nLomax said he saw the possibility of \"creating quite a bit of shareholder value\" by buying regional software companies, particularly in the banking industry.\nThe group has bought software businesses in risk management, private banking, corporate electronic banking, derivatives trading, capital markets trading --- areas where banks and securities firms want to expand and control their activities.\nIn the last 12 months, Misys's shares have more than doubled to 1140 pence from 567 pence as the group systematically targets international financial institutions that need new software at lower costs but with a greater security of transactions.\nLomax insists that he is unworried by the share price, which at about 20 times prospective earnings, no longer looks cheap. Competitors' price/earnings ratios are comparable, he says.\nBut the stock has slipped recently, and was trading 2.5 pence weaker at 1115p by 1115 GMT -- despite the strong results.\nIn terms of international banking, Misys is three to five times bigger than its competitors. Large rivals such as Reuters Holdings Plc and America's SunGard Data Systems impinge only on parts of its market, Lomax noted.\n\"Nobody of any serious calibre or size competes across the board with us.\"\nThe group lifted its half year dividend 15 percent to 4.57p.",

Talks are under way to add a number of European and Asian nations to the list.  \nAs with all roaming agreements, the financial details of the Swiss deal remain a trade secret. Initially, only subscribers in Geneva will be able to use Swiss PTT's Natel City network but Orange aims to boost coverage to Basel and Zurich by early 1997.\nOrange says its offer of roaming services between the UK and other countries is part of its aim to provide customers with the best value for money. It notes that a significant proportion of users regularly use its established German services.\n\"Adding Geneva as another roaming service demonstrates our commitment to providing an international continuity of service,\" Tucker said.  \nThe system that Orange uses is much like that of market leaders Vodafone Group and British Telecom's 60 percent-owned Cellnet, in that they are based on the GSM (global system for mobile communications) sister technology called DCS-1800, which operates at 1800 MHz as opposed to 900 MHz.\nMost of Cellnet's and Vodafone's subscribers are on the increasingly crowded analogue networks while Orange, along with rival Cable and Wireless- and U S West -owned Mercury One 2 One, is wholly digital.  \nAs mobile phone companies vie to lift the market out of its yuppie ghetto and into the mass market, the challenge for newcomers like Orange -- with its monthly rental packages that include free minutes and per-second charges -- is to attract customers who still have no mobile phone.\nIt also has to catch those as they move from the older analogue networks to the new digital technology. Orange, which last month reported gaping first-half pretax losses of 125.2 million stg, has seen its shares fall well short of the 205 pence level of its March flotation that valued the company at about 2.5 billion stg.\nBut the company, partly owned by Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Wam Poa and British Aerospace, says its expects to turn in a profit or pay shareholders a dividend by 1998.",

Existing software runs up to 10-20 percent faster.\nIntel says the new technology will boost computer sales and soon become an industry standard.\n\"The new features we have introduced with MMX technology allow a much better, richer multi-media experience...and we'll see a home and consumer demand for PCs growing even more,\" Wilson said.\nIntel said that for the first time in its history, a wide range of consumer software was available right at launch to exploit the powers of the new chip.\nThe MMX chip will initially be offered with the 166 and 200 MHz Pentium processors, improving the performance of personal computer-based multimedia and high-speed communications with faster \"modems\" for speeding access to the Internet.\nA host of computer manufacturers are offering the Pentium MMX processor, including America's International Business Machines Corp, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, Italy's Olivetti and Japan's Toshiba.\nBritish electrical retail chain Dixons said new Pentium processors with MMX technology would be available in some of its stores from Wednesday.\nWilson said he expected systems incorporating the new MMX technology to retail at between $1,500 and $2,000.\nAnalysts have estimated that Intel could sell 30 million to 45 million MMX chips this year -- about half of the microprocessor units it will sell this year.\nBut Wilson declined to comment on shipments, saying only: \"By end of year, a significant percentage of our microprocessors being shipped will be incorporating MMX technology.\"\nThe MMX chip, which is available on desktop PCs as well as on low-power portable computers, contains 4.5 million transistors and adds 57 processor instructions to speed up software instructions.\nThe added performance of the technology frees up more of the Pentium processor to work on several tasks at once, including low-cost PC videoconferencing over standard telephone lines.\nIntel said it planned to build technology to upgrade some of its older Pentium processors later this year.\nThe company does not expect a re-run of its experiences in 1992, when it was forced to recall hardware because of problems with its processor chips.\n\"I think we have learnt a lot from that experience,\" Wilson said. \"We're very confident of the quality and reliability of the product we are shipping.\"",

If markets open up and we compete, prices will come down. But we will take substantial market share, particularly in the business area where quality of service really matters.\"\nBT has operations in 30 countries and employs about 130,000 staff worldwide. Since privatisation in 1984, about 110,000 jobs have gone. The firm, which cut another 3,200 staff in the first half of this year, expects about the same number of voluntary redundancies in the second.\nAs part of its European offensive, BT has won a licence in the Netherlands, plans to win both fixed and mobile licences in Germany and has bought into a mobile licence in France where it also thinks it will win the second fixed licence.\nBrace said high-speed digital ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) lines and overseas operations were growing at about 50-100 percent per year and that the company had high hopes for its intranet initiative with software giant Microsoft Corp, where it also sees booming demand.\nBT said on Wednesday that it and MCI, whose proposed merger is the biggest transatlantic deal in history, were linking up with Microsoft to offer transnational firms private communications networks based on the internet.\nAsked whether BT, which announced its $20 billion merger with MCI on November 3, planned similar deals, Brace said few other large communications groups offered the same prospects.\n\"I'm not sure that there are similar deals as MCI -- because there aren't many companies that size in the world one would wish to merge with.\"\nAs previously announced, BT is raising its interim dividend by six percent to 7.9 pence. As part of the MCI deal, BT is also paying a special dividend of 35 pence which it expects to pay in September 1997 at the same time as the final dividend.",

Lonrho expects to announce the sale in about three weeks.\nThe sale of the hotels, which will be followed by the divestment of the group's African trading operations, is part of Lonrho's plans to turn itself into a focused mining company and ends 30 years of empire building by founder Tiny Rowland.\nStakis had been the front-runner to buy the conglomerate's Metropole chain -- four-star hotels with extensive conference facilities -- since rival Millennium & Copthorne Hotels pulled out of the bidding race earlier this month.\nThe hotels group said it expected the acquisition to boost earnings from the first year and forecast 1996 group profit before tax and exceptionals would be over 30.6 million pounds.\nStakis also forecast a final dividend of 1.2 pence per share, giving a total payout of 2.15 pence for the full year -- 23 percent more than last year.\nThe company, which had been in acquisition talks with Lonrho for about 15 months, plans to cut costs at the hotels and boost profits by boosting occupancy -- currently at about 68 percent.\nAnalysts welcomed the deal. \"The numbers stack up. I have no problem with their strategy,\" said Matthew Nayler, leisure analyst at brokers Williams de Broe.\nAnalysts estimate that Stakis will have to boost profits at the hotels -- in the cities of London and Birmingham and the seaside resorts of Brighton and Blackpool -- by at least 12 percent for the purchase to be profitable.\nIn an innovative move by investment bank Schroders that will save Stakis some money on commissions, the bank is arranging a partial tender for sub-underwriting of the rights issue by investment institutions in which sub-underwriters will be allowed to tender at lower commissions for additional sub- underwriting above their initial allocations.\nSchroders will then cut the primary underwriting commission charged to Stakis at the same rate as any reduction in total sub-underwriting charges.\n\"We may lose money but we think change (to commission rates) is inevitable,\" Schroders' Robert Swannell told reporters.\nThe market is now awaiting news on Lonrho's sale of the Princess hotels, which include resorts in Acapulco, Mexico, the Caribbean and the U.S.\nA Lonrho spokesman said news on this was expected in approximately three weeks.\nFinancial sources in the Gulf said earlier this month that the Saudi prince had exclusive rights to negotiate a deal and that the price was $300 million. The prince's key western investments include stakes in New York's luxury Plaza hotel, the Four Seasons hotel group, banking group Citicorp and the Disneyland Paris theme park.",

Armed with MCI, it also hopes to be better placed to win market share in Asia -- possibly with NTT.\n\"In one year's time, only 15 percent of BT's revenues will be covered by a price cap. And, with their European operations getting off the ground, they will have a very substantial business in international markets,\" said one analyst.\nBT and MCI's alliance, dubbed Concert Plc, still needs to win regulatory clearance in both America and Britain.\nBritain's Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said that it was still unclear whether the merger, which BT believes will be cleared in about 12 months, would fall under its remit for clearance or under that of the European Commission.\nOne of the issues that determines which regulatory authority rules on the merger will be the turnover of the new company. However, any EC decision would be made in conjunction with advice from Oftel, the British telecoms regulator, and the DTI.\nMost analysts believe that while there are hurdles to the deal, the merger is likely to be shown the green light.",

They also had approached Microsoft Corp. about jobs, said Jerry Held, Oracle senior vice president of server technologies.\n\"This is a group of senior developers that was very frustrated by the lack of vision of Informix top managers,\" Held said. \"We did no active recruiting. I was called absolutely out of the blue\" when the former Informix staff joined Oracle.\nThe lawsuit, filed on Thursday in Oregon Circuit Court in Portland, seeks unspecified damages. Informix on Thursday also obtained a temporary injunction barring the former employees from giving trade secrets to Oracle, Informix said.\nInformix also charged Gary Kelley, a former Informix product development vice president who left for Oracle, with breach of contract. Kelley did not return phone calls to Oracle's Portland facility.\nInformix, based in Menlo Park, Calif., and Oracle, based 20 miles north in Redwood Shores, Calif., both write sophisticated programmes that store and retrieve huge amounts of information in corporate computer networks.\nThe companies for years have been fighting a marketing war touting their advances in database technology with each new release of their respective flagship products.\nWhite said he believed Oracle was interested in gaining Informix's expertise in writing software for so-called massively parallel computers -- top-of-the-line machines that can process huge amounts of transactions simultaneously.\nThe 11 Informix employees who left for Oracle were working on this type of product, White said.\nHeld said Oracle does not have an interest in Informix's technology because Oracle is ahead in that area.\n\"Oracle has had parallel technology for years,\" Held said. \"Informix is playing catch-up. Phil has a knack for being behind and saying he's ahead.\"\nTechnology debates aside, the spat is the most serious between the companies in years. White, normally a publicity-shy executive, said he was livid about Oracle's tactics and intended to make the lawsuit a political cause in Silicon Valley for preventing employee raids.\nWhite said he personally went to the home of Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison on Thursday night to discuss the issue, but Ellison was in Hong Kong. Both men live in the same small town in Silicon Valley.\n\"I'm doing this not only for Informix and for our shareholders but also for the industry,\" White said. \"We can't let companies come in and throw big financial incentives and walk away with intellectual property we spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing.\"\nIn recent years, several software rivals in Silicon Valley have accused each other of trade secret theft by employee snatching.\nIn 1992, Borland International Inc. accused a former employee of sending confidential electronic mail to new employer Symantec Corp.. Last year, Cadence Design Systems Inc.. filed a similar charges against direct competitor Avant Corp..\nThe court has set a hearing in the Informix case for Feb. 7.",

        "Text": "Apple Computer Inc. Wednesday reported a $120 million loss in its fiscal first quarter and warned investors it did not expect to report a profit until September.\nThe troubled computer maker, based in Cupertino, Calif., also said it expected revenue for the current fiscal year, which ends next September, to drop about 13 percent to $8 billion to $8.5 billion because of weak consumer sales.\nApple's loss, which equaled 96 cents a share, compared with a loss of $69 million, or 56 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Sales for the quarter ended Dec. 27 fell to $2.13 billion from $3.15 billion.\nApple attributed the latest quarterly loss to slow sales of consumer-oriented Performa desktop computers during the crucial Christmas quarter, which analysts said was partly due to concerns about Apple's future.\n\"Apple's been under a black cloud, and part of it has been Apple's doing,\" said Lou Mazzucchelli, analyst at brokerage Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York. \"It's hard for a consumer to get the gumption to buy a Performa when everyone's asking, 'Is Apple dead yet?'\"\nApple officials said the company will unveil in coming weeks its second restructuring program in two years, aimed at cutting operating costs by $400 million.\nThe plan could include more job cuts, Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson said. Apple wants to reduce its break-even point to $8 billion in annual revenues to enable it to return to profitability by the end of September.\nPreviously, Apple had promised to return to sustainable profits by March. But industry analysts had started to question that goal after Apple disclosed less than two weeks ago that sales of its Performa line were running behind plan.\nApple, which posted a record loss last year of $816 million, has been struggling to return to profitability in the face of increased competition from computers using Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system and Intel Corp.'s computer chips.\nLast February, Apple replaced Chief Executive Michael Spindler with National Semiconductor Corp. boss Gilbert Amelio and then, in December, announced a reunion with former co-founder Steven Jobs when it agreed to acquire Job's Next Software Inc. for $400 million.\nMeanwhile, debt rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered Apple's corporate credit and debt rating another notch Wednesday, putting the company's debt further into junk bond status.\nThe rating agency said the downgrade reflected the challenges facing Apple, including reducing costs and restoring revenue growth, executing a cohesive operating system upgrade upon completion of the Next acquisition, and Apple's diminished liquidity and financial resources.\n\"Despite its position among the top five worldwide personal computer manufacturers ... Apple has been struggling with extremely competitive industry conditions, slipping market share, and operating losses,\" the rating agency said.\nDespite the slowdown in Performa sales, Anderson said Apple's financial position remained strong.\n\"While we were very disappointed by the Performa sales results and the associated loss, our financial position remains sound,\" he said. \"We exited the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash.\"\nAnderson said there were some bright spots in its results. European shipments rose 50 percent in the first quarter from the fourth quarter. Sales to educational organizations also were above the company's goals, Anderson said.\nStill, Performa sales, which account for about a third of Apple's revenues, will be weak for the rest of the year. \"We had a major problem in this one product area,\" he said.\nAnalysts said the loss, which Apple forecast two weeks ago, represented a setback for Amelio. He had set a goal of stanching Apple's losses in 1996 and getting revenue growing again by 1998.\nNews of the latest loss can drive even more consumers to avoid buying Apple products, analysts said.\n\"The question is, can Apple wait until 1998 to get its growth engine going again?\" said Walter Winnitzki, analyst at broker PaineWebber Inc. in New York.\nApple reported its results after the market closed. Apple closed at $17.25 a share, down 62.5 cents, on Nasdaq.",

Microsoft is scheduled to report results on Oct. 21.\nBetter-than-expected sales of personal computers in the past few months also will contribute to Microsoft's revenue, analysts said. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., makes about a quarter of its revenue from the sale of its Windows family of operating systems.  Operating systems are the type of software that controls the basic functions of every PC.  \nMicrosoft benefits from strong PC sales because PC makers have to pay Microsoft a royalty for every copy of Windows they pack in the boxes of new machines.\nWall Street expects Microsoft to earn $0.90 a share, according to a survey of 24 analysts by First Call.  In the same quarter a year ago, Microsoft earned $0.78.\nNovell Inc, the biggest publisher of computer networking software, is not expected to perform as well.  \nThe company is struggling to sell its NetWare flagship -- which controls the flow of computer information through departmental computer departments -- in the face of competition with Microsoft's Windows.  Novell, based in Provo, Utah, also still faces management issues following the resignation of Bob Frankenberg, the former chief executive officer, said David Takata, an analyst at Gruntal & Co in Los Angeles.\n\"They clearly still have a lot of work to do\" to get the company's management in order, Takata said.  \nNovell is expected to earn $0.18 a share in its fiscal fourth quarter, compared with $0.16 a year ago, according to a First Call survey of 17 analysts.\nMeanwhile, vendors of software for large, corporate computer networks and database management tools are expected to continue to post substantial gains in the third quarter on continuing strong demand.\n\"For a relatively mature market, this niche is still growing at a good clip,\" said Jim Pickrel, an analyst at Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco.  \nPickrel said he expects Oracle and Informix Corp to report the most impressive results on strong sales of their database software -- computer programs which help big companies keep track of huge libraries of corporate information.  Both are taking business from Sybase Inc,  another database software publisher, which is still struggling to recover from marketing and technical shortcomings last year.\nSybase,is expected to report it broke even in the quarter, not counting charges for a restructuring, Pickrel said.  In the year-earlier quarter, Sybase earned $0.01 a share.  \nOracle, the biggest database software publisher, is expected to earn $0.27 a share for the fiscal second quarter ending November, according to a recent survey of 27 analysts by First Call.  A year ago in the same quarter, it earned $0.21.\nHambrecht & Quist's Pickrel said Informix could pass Sybase this quarter in revenue to become the second biggest database vendor.

Included in the most recent quarter's operating results was a gain of $17 million.\nFourth-quarter revenue for fiscal 1996 declined 23 percent to $2.32 billion from $3 billion.\nApple released the news after the market closed and its shares jumped as much as $4.25 to $30 a share in after-hours trading.\nIndustry analysts attributed the profit to Apple's aggressive cost cutting, a bigger-than-expected exodus of employees and lower prices for key components, such as memory chips.\n\"It is a shock,\" said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst at JP Morgan in San Francisco who was expecting a loss. \"It seems they've brought the break-even point for their business down pretty dramatically. This is very encouraging.\"\nMost important to investors, Apple could remain profitable in coming quarters, which would bolster confidence among consumers that it will be around for years and keep loyal customers from switching to IBM-compatible personal computers, analysts said.\nFred Anderson, Apple's chief financial officer, stopped short of predicting a profit in the first fiscal quarter.\nHe said, however, that he expects the company's costs to increase only slightly in the December quarter on higher advertising expenses and that first-quarter revenue should be about the same as in the fourth fiscal quarter.\n\"We continue to make progress in strengthening Apple's financial condition, as our $410 million in positive cash flow from operations during the quarter suggests,\" Anderson said.\n\"We've reduced inventories by nearly $400 million since June and completed the quarter with over $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments,\" he said in a statement.\nIn the previous three quarters, Apple reported huge losses because of declining Macintosh sales, management turmoil and growing popularity of personal computers running Microsoft's Windows software, which compete with Macintosh.\nThe company began slashing its costs when former National Semiconductor Corp. chief Gilbert Amelio took charge of Apple in February.\nWith most of the cost-cutting plan completed, Apple now will concentrate on the much tougher task of increasing revenue, Anderson said.\nWhile shipments were down 26 percent in the fourth quarter to 932,000 units from the year-ago quarter, Apple said shipments were up 11 percent from the third quarter, a sign that customers were once again buying Apple's products.\nApple has a slew of new products in the works.\nOn Monday, the company is expected to unveil a new low-end PowerBook, a much-needed portable computer to replace Apple's older glitch-prone models.\nIn the first calendar quarter, the company also is expected to introduce new low-end consumer desktop models, a niche from which Apple had retreated in an effort to cut costs.\nFor the full year, Apple reported a loss of $816 million, or $6.59 a share, reflecting a series of hefty one-time charges for inventory writedowns and restructurings. In fiscal 1995, Apple earned $424 million, or $3.45 a share.\nRevenue for the year fell 11 percent to $9.83 billion from $11.1 billion a year ago.",

For the price of a $2,500 multimedia PC, a school can buy three eMates, Apple executives said.\n\"The federal government says we need to get to a three-to-one student-to-computer ratio by the year 2000,\" said Jim Groff, general manager of Apple's information appliances group. \"I would say the eMate is the only credibled vehicle for accomplishing that.\"\nMore vital to Apple, the product could keep educators from abandoning the company as the leading supplier of computers for classrooms, analysts said.\n\"The potential for something like this in a classroom setting is tremendous,\" said Mike McGuire, a mobile computing analyst at Dataquest Inc. \"This will be an indication to educators that Apple is one of the few companies spending time extending computing to more and more kids.\"\nApple needs a distinctive product to set itself apart from other personal computer makers crowding into the education market, analysts said.\nAlthough Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., still enjoys strong educational sales, sales of IBM-compatible personal computers by companies such as Compaq Computer Corp. are growing much faster.\nApple's computer has always been the favored tool for teaching children how to use computers. But in the face of Apple's uncertain future and a flood of cheap PCs, schools are less likely to remain loyal.\nFor the 1996-1997 school year, of all the computers that schools plan to buy, 56 percent will be Apple Macintoshs and 40 percent IBM-compatible machines, according to a recent report by Quality Education Data, an education market researcher. In the previous school year, the purchasing plans were 61 percent Macintosh and 38 percent PC.\n\"The numbers are overwhelming in favor of PCs,\" said Carole Cotton, president of CCA Consulting Inc., another tracker of technology purchases by schools.\n\"No school district can afford to make a mistake\" when picking computers they will use for years, she noted.\nApple's Groff said, however, that the eMate is not the company's answer to competitors' inroads.\nInstead, he said, the device was built for schools asking for a cheap, powerful computer that can offer educational software and Internet connections -- as well as endure rough handling by kids.\n\"When we introduced the Newton three years ago, it was a solution in search of an application,\" Groff said. Education turned out to be one of the best applications, he said.\nAlong with the eMate, Apple plans to unveil a beefier version of the Newton MessagePad on Monday. The new MessagePad 2000 features better Internet capabilities, easier connection to PCs and built-in word processing and spreadsheet software.\nAnalysts said, however, that the eMate is the more interesting device. Teachers and students will like it because it is not as esoteric and hard to run as a traditional personal computer.\n\"Kids are having to learn more about how to run a computer than about reading and writing,\" McGuire said. \"The ability to have the kid just turn on the device and get right into the writing assigment is really valuable.\"\nThe eMate weighs four pounds (1.8 kg) and fits into a backpack. It can run for a week on rechargeable batteries, according to Apple.\nThe machine features a built-in word processor, drawing and equation-drawing programs and an address book. With an optional modem and software, students can browse the Internet.\nStill, the eMate could be a tough sell for Apple.\nBecause its software is based on the Newton operating system, it cannot run the thousands of educational programs written for the Macintosh and for PCs running Microsoft Corp.'s Windows software.\nApple executives are confident, however, that the eMate will help the company place more its computers on students' desks.\n\"There's 52 million screaming (grades) K-to-12 children to sell to,\" said Robert Kondrk, Apple's manager of education product lines. \"We've known for years this is an opportunity, but we didn't have the technology to do it before.

        "Text": "Macromedia Inc. shares plunged to a two-year low Friday after the software company reported an unexpected third-quarter loss and said it could face weak sales for another quarter.\nSome analysts said they also were concerned that Apple Computer Inc.'s declining sales could hurt Macromedia's revenue from sale of software for Macintosh computers in coming quarters.\nShares of the San Francisco graphics software vendor fell $4.19, or 31 percent, to $9.31 in Nasdaq trading -- the lowest price since December 1994.\nMacromedia on Thursday reported a loss of $2.36 million, or 6 cents a share, for its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with net income of $7.15 million, or 18 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago. Third-quarter revenue fell 9 percent to $28.1 million from $30.9 million.\nWall Street expected Macromedia to report net income of 14 cents a share, according to a recent survey of analysts by First Call.\nMacromedia gets about half its revenue from Director, a computer program that helps graphic artists make animated clips for video games and multimedia software.\nMacromedia customers are putting off Director purchases until the company releases a new version in a couple of months, analysts said.\n\"We are left with the concern that there will be a dip in revenue\" in the fourth quarter as well, said Kevane Wong, analyst at brokerage firm Jefferies & Co. in San Francisco.\nMacromedia also gets about 60 percent of its revenue from Macintosh software sales. A slow rollout of high-end Macintosh PCs in Europe led to slow European sales for Macromedia as well, said Ed Bierdeman, analyst at Dakin Securities.\n\"The Mac market is like a block of ice melting in the sun,\" leaving many Mac software vendors, including Macromedia, to suffer, Bierdeman said.\nMacromedia likely will post a small loss in its fiscal fourth quarter, ending in March, Bierdeman said.\nSeveral analysts also said they were concerned Macromedia might not be able to finish the new version of Director until spring, which would jeopordize earnings until the quarter ended in June.\nMacromedia officials could not be reached for comment immediately.",

        "Text": "Apple Computer Inc. Chairman Gilbert Amelio said Tuesday the computer maker's three-year turnaround plan was still on track despite its statement last week that it will report a first-quarter operating loss of as much as $150 million.\nAmelio, speaking to thousands of Macintosh computer enthusiasts at the MacWorld trade show here also called on several star computer industry executives to express their support for the Macintosh.\nIn his much-anticipated keynote speech, Amelio assured Mac customers the company will have a smooth transition as Apple shores up its finances and overhauls the fundamental software of the Macintosh.\n\"We will encounter a few bumps on the way, but I don't want that to shake your confidence,\" Amelio told Macintosh customers and software developers. \"We are sticking to our strategy.\"\nApple has been struggling for the past year to stop huge financial losses, develop new software to make the Mac more modern and increase revenues. Under Apple's three year plan, it aims to stop financial losses in 1996, develop new products in 1997 and increase revenues in 1998.\nSince Amelio became chairman of the Cupertino, Calif.-based company a year ago, he has slashed costs. In December, Apple also agreed to buy NeXT Software Inc. for $400 million to get its help in revamping the fundamental software of the Mac.\nIn order to move developers smoothly from Apple's current operating system to the new system, Apple said it plans to continue to deliver regularly scheduled upgrades to the current system while accelerating development of a new and advanced operating system.\nThe new operating system, code-named \"Rhapsody,\" will be based on the merging of technologies from Apple and NeXT.\n\"Our goal is to be one of the world's strongest brands for consumer, education and the enterprise,\" Apple co-founder and Next Software President Steven Jobs said, adding Apple hoped to rely on Next's multimedia and computing intensive software to accomplish that goal.\nApple said Friday it expected to report a loss from operations of $100 million to $150 million because of weak sales of its Performa line of Macintosh computers. Revenue for the company's first quarter ended Dec. 27 is expected to drop 10 percent from the $2.3 billion reported in the September quarter.\nAmelio blamed the shortfall on weak consumer sales for personal computers rather than a breakdown of Apple's strategy.\n\"We had one thing that really fell out of bed in a big way and that is, Santa Claus forgot to come,\" he said, referring to the surprisingly low sales of its Performa desktop PC line aimed at consumers.\nThe first quarter \"was about retail sales, not about the fundamentals in the recovery of Apple,\" Amelio told a packed ballroom.\nIndustry experts say part of the blame for declining revenue falls on the perception that there is not as much software for the Macintosh as there is for PCs running Windows software from Microsoft Corp..\nTo boost the Mac's image, Amelio turned to executives from Microsoft, Sun Microsystems Inc., and Netscape Communications Corp. to announce software plans for future versions of the Mac.\n\"We see great opportunities for the Mac in the future,\" said Paul Maritz, Microsoft vice president in charge of application development.\nAt Macworld, Microsoft introduced its Internet Explorer browser for the Mac.\nThe Redmond, Wash.-based software giant, which has often battled Apple for control of the PC industry, also said it created a new product unit responsible for design and development of a Macintosh version of its widely used Microsoft Office software suite.\nWhile Microsoft remains Apple's great nemesis in the operating systems software business, Microsoft also has long served as the leading independent developer of software applications that run on Apple Macintosh computers.\n\"When Apple's biggest third-party developer decides to commit new resources to its Macintosh applications business, that's a pretty clear sign that there's still money to be made in the Macintosh market,\" said Jeffrey Tarter, an industry analyst and publisher of Soft*Letter.\nThe creation of the new Macintosh product unit, part of the Microsoft desktop applications division, marks the first time in the history of the division that an entire product unit has focused exclusively on the Macintosh, Microsoft said.\nJames Barksdale, chief executives of Internet software vendor Netscape, also said his company will release versions of its communication software within the next few weeks that will run on Apple's next-generation operating system.\nApple's stock closed down 37.5 cents at $17.50 on Nasdaq.",

        "Text": "Jilted once, financial software company Intuit Inc appears unlikely to return to the merger altar any time soon.\nBuyout speculation has swirled around Intuit since May 1995, when Microsoft Corp. dumped its plans to buy the maker of popular personal finance software like Quicken and TurboTax. Last week, Intuit shares surged again on speculation American Express Co. was about to make an offer.  \nHowever, many industry analysts believe such a deal is not in Intuit's future, adding the best way for Intuit to grow is to attract as many partners as it can to set up online banking services.\n\"My personal belief is that Intuit is best able to maximize its value on its own,\" said David Farina, an analyst at William Blair.\nIntuit's key asset is Quicken, a program that helps computer users track checkbook balances, check stock portfolios, pay bills, plan monthly budgets and lay out retirement plans.  \nThe company depends on partnerships with dozens of banks and brokerages to provide online links between customers' personal computers and their accounts.\nIntuit would turn off most of its partners if it were acquired by a big financial partner, Scott Cook, Intuit's chairman, insists.\n\"We would never become a captive of one financial institution or a small group of financial institutions,\" Cook told a group of investors in Florida on Friday.  \nStill, some analysts questioned whether Intuit has the marketing and financial muscle to compete on its own against Microsoft for long.\nMicrosoft, the world's biggest personal computer software company, is spending a big chunk of its $2 billion research and development budget on financial software and online banking services provided through the Internet.\nAlthough Intuit still controls 70 percent of the market for personal financial software, Microsoft is gaining.  \nIntuit also needs capital to expand into new area, such as giving online investment advice, said Karen Epper, an analyst at Forrester Research, a market researcher. Such forays will likely hurt profits, she said.\n\"They might get dinged on their stock price, but this area is more in line with the consumer marketing business model they have,\" Epper said.\nIt could be years, however, before Intuit's push into new areas could pay off, Epper said.\nIntuit said in September it expects lower revenue growth in the current fiscal year ending July 1997.  \nThe company blamed a slow market for consumer software. Some of the shortfall is because of one-time suitor Microsoft, analysts said.\nIn October 1994, Microsoft stunned Wall Street by offering to buy Intuit for more than $1 billion, the biggest acquisition attempt in the software industry at the time.\nMicrosoft was willing to pay that huge sum to turn Quicken into a gateway for online banking services, an industry that's expected to rival brick-and-mortar retail banking in revenue in the next ten years.  \nMicrosoft backed out of the deal in May 1995, however, when the Justice Department said it would sue Microsoft on antitrust grounds if it pursued the transaction.\nSince then, Microsoft has spent hundreds of millions beefing up its rival Microsoft Money financial management program. The company also set up a division to sell networking and Internet software to banks.\nTo counter Microsoft's redoubled efforts, Intuit set up a business to process online transactions -- such as bill payments and account transfers -- between banks and depositors. Some investors saw the unit, Intuit Services Corp., as a promising source of revenue.\nIn September, however, Intuit sold the unit to rival Checkfree Corp., partly because it did not have the expertise to handle huge volumes of transactions.\nBanks also were reluctant to have Intuit sit between them and their depositors, Epper said. Most banks preferred to reach their customers through the Internet instead of Intuit's proprietary network.\n\"Intuit is staring down the barrel of a gun, and that gun is the Internet, which is making financial management easier,\" Epper said.\nIt could be a while before Intuit outlines a new strategy for growing its business, analysts said.\nMeanwhile, there may be more bouts of wishful thinking about an acquisition, they said.",

        "Text": "Apple Computer Inc. Wednesday reported a $120 million loss in the first quarter of fiscal 1997 and warned investors it did not expect to return to profitability until September.\nThe troubled computer maker attributed the loss to slow sales of its its consumer-oriented Performa desktop computers during the normally robust Christmas quarter.\nApple's loss, which equalled 96 cents a share, compared with a loss of $69 million, or 56 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Sales for its first fiscal quarter ended on Dec. 27 fell to $2.13 billion from $3.15 billion.\nBased on the weak first quarter results, the company said it planned to develop additional restructuring programmes during the second quarter with the goals of reducing its break-even point to $8 billion in annual revenues and enabling Apple to return to  profitability by the fourth fiscal quarter, which ends Sept. 26, 1997.\nPreviously, Apple had promised to return to sustainable profits by March but industry analysts had started to question that goal after Apple disclosed less than two weeks ago that sales of its Performa line were running behind plan.\n\"While we were very disappointed by the Performa sales results and the associated loss, our financial position remains sound,\" said Apple Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson. \"We exited the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and continued to show improvements in our inventory management during the quarter.\n\"Additionally we saw a 15 percent sequential increase in our high-end Power Macintosh sales,\" he said. \"We significantly exceeded our internal plans for shipments of PowerBooks and expect their availability to continue to improve in the second quarter.\"\nNevertheless, analysts said the results, which Apple forecast less than two weeks ago represented a setback for Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio, who had set a goal of stanching Apple's losses in 1996.\n\"Our expectations now do not show a profit until the fourth quarter, which ends in September,\" said Walter Winnitzki, analyst at brokerage PainWebber Inc. in New York.",

        "Text": "When Apple Computer Inc. fired co-founder Steven Jobs in 1985, Apple employees did not know whether to cry or to rejoice.\nThrough the early 1980s, Jobs had inspired Apple engineers to create a computer called the Macintosh which would change the world. At the same time, though, Jobs and his mercurial temper burned out many of the same engineers who adorded him.\nOn Friday, more than 11 years after Jobs was ousted in a stunning boardroom coup, Apple took a huge gamble by bringing him back.\nHis assignment is to help the Cupertinto, California-based computer company revamp the software behind the Macintosh, an effort that had been mired for three years.\nThe bet is that Jobs is the only person who can inspire Apple's demoralized programmers to create software that would leapfrog Microsoft Corp's competing Windows operating system.\n\"He will help tremendously,\" said Randy Wigginton, a former Apple programmer who worked under Jobs to write the software of the original Mac. \"Steve is incredibly bright, talented, amusing.\"\nOn Friday, as word of Apple's decision to rehire Jobs spread, shares of the company rose $1.25 or 5.6 percent, to $23.50.\nJob's new company, NeXT Software Inc., which Apple agreed to acquire on Friday for $400 million, offers a computer operating system that has many of the software bells and whistles Apple has been looking for to catch up with rival Microsoft.\nApple had tried to reach a deal with closely held software company Be Inc., founded by another former Apple executive, Jean-Louis Gassee, but the talks broke down and the company turned to Jobs for help.\nWith NeXT's existing technology, Apple hopes to finish the overhaul of its popular Macintosh operating system -- the type of program that controls the fundamental functions of a computer -- in late 1997.\nBut the key asset that Apple acquired is Jobs. He will serve part-time as a technology adviser and will report to Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio.\nSeveral Apple programmers working on the Mac overhaul said they have been frustrated for months with a string of weak managers who could not get the project past a rough sketch even after three years. With Jobs, the programmers said, they hope the project can finally move forward.\n\"Everybody is excited,\" said an Apple employee close to the project. \"I am very excited.\"\nThe risk of hiring Jobs is his volatility. People who have worked for him said Jobs has a knack for inspiring engineers to think that their work is a life-or-death project, a sentiment Apple now needs. But the same sentiment can burn engineers out.\n\"In some ways he has mellowed, but he still has an incessant drive for perfection,\" said Joanna Hoffman, the Mac's first marketing manager.\nJobs could not be reached on Saturday for comment. On Friday he told reporters he was looking forward to rejoining the company he co-founded nearly 20 years ago out of his parent's garage.\n\"I feel very lucky to be a part-time Apple employee and work for Gil and advise him on product strategy.\"\nJobs also will work with Apple Chief Technical Officer Ellen Hancock, a veteran International Business Machines Corp. software manager who has set specific goals for the operating system team.\nJobs' visionary role and Hancock's strict, no-nonsense management style balance nicely, said Tim Bajarin, analyst at market researcher Creative Strategies Research.",

        "Text": "She once jokingly thought of calling her autobiography \"Fascist Bitch,\" and now Canadian journalists are wondering what epithet to use as she plays an expanding role in the country's largest newspaper empire.\nBritish-born Barbara Amiel, the wife of Hollinger Inc. chairman Conrad Black, is an accomplished journalist who counts many fans in Britain, where she writes a rightwing shoot-from-the-hip column for the Daily Telegraph, the centerpiece of the Hollinger empire.\nAlthough she honed her craft in Canada, she makes many Canadians bristle by standing out from the mass of generally liberal journalists. She says she has never managed to reap the accolades she desires from Canadians, the ones she routinely receives from the British.\nA sought-after London party guest, Amiel now is in the Canadian spotlight through her position as vice president of editorial in her husband's newspaper empire. Hollinger added a majority shareholding in Southam Inc., the country's largest daily newspaper chain, to its media stable, substantially boosting its control to more than 40 percent of the industry.\nThe move left some Canadians worried about Hollinger's influence on their media and many Southam journalists fearful for their jobs as Black's well-known road to profits often involves cutting newspaper staff.\nHUSBAND CAN SPEAK FOR HIMSELF\nAt a recent conference of journalists in Ottawa, Amiel, a former Toronto Sun editor, was repeatedly asked about Black's intentions. She replied that he could speak for himself. But she added, \"I think the Southam papers ... have not done their best but have terrific potential.\"\nAmiel, who still writes for Maclean's magazine, hesitated when asked if she was treated differently in Canada than abroad. \"I think Canada's been very good to me. I became editor of a newspaper, (former editor) Peter Newman gave me a column in Maclean's magazine, how many people have got that? You can't complain.\"\nBut then she added, \"I've never, although one always wants it, had the recognition of my peers that I've had in England, but then maybe I didn't deserve it in Canada.\"\nTelevision personality Alan Edmonds, an admirer of Amiel who disagrees with her views, said Canadians have refrained from praising Amiel's talents because of her rightwing bias. \"In the years that she was in Canada ... the prevailing mindset in the media was in the opposite direction.\"\nEdmonds said other journalists were jealous of the openings that came her way. \"She's used her undoubted feminine attraction to ... create opportunities to use her undoubted superior intellect.\"\nIn person and in print, Amiel has a knack for sparking debates. For instance, she once wrote that Quebec's moves toward independence, culminating in a narrow 1995 defeat for the separatists, could be blamed on Canada's liberal elite, which promoted multi-culturalism, thereby strengthening French-Canadian nationalism.\nCASTIGATING LEFTWINGERS\nHer columns have castigated Ontario's former leftwing government, led by the New Democratic Party, for allegedly being swayed by special interest groups like the disabled. She also wrote that Ontario, which gave homosexual couples the same rights as heterosexual ones, had weakened the family.\nCanada's most widely read satirical magazine, Frank, noted \"a favorite theme in her columns is the insidiousness of self-pity, that the poor should get on with their lives and quit carping about it.\" And columnist Allan Fotheringham once observed, \"Barbara Amiel, otherwise known as Mrs. Conrad Black, can take out any opponent in the world and eat them for breakfast. As she does regularly in print.\"\nAmiel has even joked about her reputation, saying she thought about calling her surprisingly frank 1980 autobiography \"Fascist Bitch,\" a name suggested by irate readers. Instead the book was titled \"Confessions.\"\nNow in her mid-50s, the much-married Amiel began her path at the tender age of eight at a \"grotty little newspaper\" in her hometown of Hendon, England. Her parents divorced, her mother remarried and her new Canadian stepfather dragged his new family back home. Amiel, used to fine surroundings, ended up in Hamilton, a gritty steel town in southern Ontario about 40 miles (70 km) from Toronto.\nBefore her 1991 marriage to Black, she was married to student Gary Smith, philosopher George Jonas and cable magnate David Graham, with whom she returned to England in 1985.\nIn 1993 well-known Canadian author Margaret Atwood published \"The Robber Bride\" about a scapel-assisted femme fatale named Zenia. The Canadian rumor mill identified Amiel as the model for Zenia, but she denied it.",

Control blocks are not considered part of a stock's weighting because these shares cannot freely trade in the market.\nUnder the new rules, the federal government's 18.26 percent holding in Petro-Canada Inc will be included in the company's overall float. Petro-Canada's will therefore see its weighting rise to 1.22 percent from about 1.03 percent.\nThe TSE is changing the definition of a control block to comply with Ontario Securities Commission reporting rules, said Tara O'Donnell, director of derivative markets management.\nThe Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board, one of Canada's biggest pension fund managers, will need to make some changes, said Zev Frishman, manager of quantitative products.\nTeachers' has almost C$45 billion in assets with a third of its money in Canadian equities.\n\"I cannot go into specific numbers or anything like that, but in essence we will have to, to some extent, adjust positions,\" Frishman said.\nBarrick will likely be one of the stocks snapped up, analysts said.\nBarrick, which is 15.7 percent owned by Trizec Hahn Corp, will now be weighted based on 100 percent of its shares from 84.3 percent. As a result, the world's third largest gold producer will see its relative weighting in the TSE 300 increase to 3.28 percent from 2.84 percent.\nLoewen's weighting will jump to about 1.74 percent from about 0.64 percent, after a control block held by chief executive Raymond Loewen and his wife is included.\nOntario Municipal Employees Retirement Services (OMERS) said it expected the control block changes to have little impact on its funds.\n\"You have to remember that the actual changes relative to the market overall are quite small,\" said Tom Gunn, senior vice-president of OMERS' investment division.\nThe list of 30 affected stocks also includes gold producer Franco-Nevada Mining Corp Ltd, Quebecor Printing Inc, publisher Hollinger Inc, energy firm Gulf Canada Resources Ltd and Shaw Industries Ltd.\nOthers are Astral Communications Inc, BC Sugar Refinery Ltd, CCL Industries Inc and Co-Steel Inc, Corel Corp, Cognos Inc, Cinram Ltd., Edper Group Ltd and First Marathon Inc and Tee-Comm Electronics Inc.",

The group led half of Toronto's 14 sub-indices higher.\nOther strong sectors included real estate and utilities. Base metals, conglomerates and communications led the weak side.\nAmong hot stocks, Edper Group Ltd. receipts soared C$7.50 to close at C$78.50 on 4.2 million shares amid market speculation that talks over the World Financial Center in New York would soon conclude, leaving majority shareholders' Bronfman group in clear control.\n* Bank of Montreal jumped C$1.10 to C$42.70, while National Bank of Canada rose C$0.40 to C$13.65.\n* Air Canada shares gained C$0.45 to close at C$5.80 as investors appeared to shun troubled Canadian Airlines Corp. in favor of Canada's largest air carrier.\n* Canadian Airlines fell C$0.36 to C$1.25 today after announcing a four-year C$800 million (US$599 million) restructuring plan on Friday.",

Of that, 24.8 million tonnes will go to export markets.\nWhile not among the biggest customers for U.S. soybean products, China is expected to buy around one million tonnes of beans in calendar 1996, and up to two million tonnes of meal.",

In 1995, they were 15 million.\nJason Zheng, senior China and regional steel analyst at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, said he estimated China's steel stockpile at 30 million tonnes.\nThe quality was unknown but doubtful, he said, and so should not dent China's need for high quality product.  \nChina would probably import between 12 and 15 million tonnes of steel in 1996, trade and industry sources said.\n\"What they need is a quality they can't get at home,\" the Western executive said.\nImports from the Commonwealth of Independent States were falling, Zheng said, \"because it is low quality stuff and if you only have 12 to 15 million tonnes of imports, you must have a higher quality product coming in\".\nHowever, industry sources said China's steel market was weak and beset by a lack of cash for buyers -- and a rising incidence of contract washouts.  \n\"Buyers are not willing to pay for their orders, not just because they don't have the cash, but because the price drops between order and delivery time and they are rejecting the cargoes or asking us to reduce the price,\" the Japanese executive said\nA source with another Japanese steelmaker said major Japanese mills had cut their prices by 10 to 15 percent to hold on to their Chinese customers.\n\"So the obvious trend is that demand is not growing as the Japanese mills had expected and as a result they have a lot of surplus to push onto the market,\" he said.  \n\"The problem is that even though China's state-owned manufacturers are trying to produce more, they are having problems getting hard currency to buy the raw materials.\"\nChina's annual steel demand was around 95 million tonnes, trading sources said.\nChina's Ministry of Metallurgical Industry said in July that steel demand would reach an annual 120 million tonnes by 2000.\nThe Ministry set an annual output target of 130 million tonnes by 2000, and said production would increase by five million tonnes a year between 1996 and 2000.",

We said it didn't and they rejected that,\" he said.\nThe rejection threatened U.S. poultry markets in China and had also been extended to poultry and poultry meat imports from the Netherlands for the same reason, he said.\nOfficials of the U.S. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service would travel from the United States to meet their Chinese counterparts.

He was referring to the practice of some Chinese importers of refusing to pay for commodities if the price falls between order and delivery.  \nFernandez did not elaborate on the details of cooperation Chile was hoping for with China. \"We are at the beginning (of discussions),\" he said.\nHe was in Hong Kong after a four-day trip to Beijing where he met with senior Chinese officials, including Minister for Foreign Affairs Qian Qichen and Minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi.\nThe purpose of his visit was to lay the groundwork for a visit to Chile on November 6 and 7 by Chinese Premier Li Peng, he said.\nFernandez said he asked Chinese officials to consider recognising Chile as free of Mediterranean fruit fly, as Japan had already done, and free of foot-and-mouth disease.\n\"The Chilean dream is to sell one apple, one bunch of grapes and one bottle of wine a year to every Chinese person,\" he said.",

        "Text": "Up to 100,000 tonnes of copper held in Shanghai bonded warehouses, confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate, probably belongs to China's strategic state reserve, industry sources said on Friday.\nAround 40,000 tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou, where some of the strategic stockpile was stored, they said.  \nJust who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into Shanghai by the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp (CNIEC) in June and July.\nIt was unclear whether or not the 40,000 tonnes had cleared customs -- which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve, administered directly by the central government's State Planning Commission, owned the copper.\nTraders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties -- three percent import tax and 17 percent value-added tax -- that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise.  \nBut one source, the head of a Hong Kong trading house, said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not.\n\"If they spend all this money moving the copper to Yingkou, it will be sitting there for years,\" he said.\n\"Once it arrives in Yingkou, it is subject to monitoring by the State Planning Commission, which has to give permission for any more movement; it is out of the hands of traders,\" he said.\nMystery has surrounded the Shanghai stockpile in recent months, with traders unsure not only of who owns it, but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it.  \nTrading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the London Metal Exchange (LME).\nA backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price.\nCNIEC lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper onto the LME between April and June 1995 on behalf of the state reserve, running the state stockpile down to 115,000 tonnes from 200,000 tonnes previously.  \nTraders in Asia said CNIEC could well have lent it to the market at around US$2,700 a tonne, and then paid somewhere between $2,200 and $2,400 a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year.\nThis would have cleared CNIEC a healthy profit, which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs.\nWord that CNIEC had offered the copper to European trading houses in a series of secret meetings unnerved an already jittery market.  \nIndustry analysts Bloomsbury Minerals Economics (BME) said on Wednesday the motivation of the owners of the 85,000 tonnes, \"whoever they are, is the most important short-term fundamental\" in an already tight world market.\nBME repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by Sumitomo Corp, with CNIEC said to be helping the Japanese trader unload its copper positions after it revealed in June losses of $1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised deals.\nSumitomo and CNIEC have made no comments on the talk and Chinese traders said they know nothing of such an arrangement.  \nTraders in Shanghai said on Thursday they were unaware of movements out of the Shanghai bonded warehouses. They reported more arrivals that were probably spot purchases.\nThey also expressed concern that the tonnage in bonded warehouses would move onto the domestic market.\nBut these concerns were irrelevant, a Singapore trader said, despite a forecast that domestic Chinese copper demand could hit one million tonnes this year.  \nAs with many commodities, \"there is a desire (by the Chinese government) to keep a stockpile of the metal,\" he said. \"You don't keep it to help industry, you keep it in case of emergency.\"",

The main concern was if December copper came close to $2,600, where there was a large concentration of open interest on calls.\nWith LME stocks at 92,475 tonnes and the spot price at 2,470.50, the LME does not have enough copper to cover calls with a strike price of $2,600, which total 168,750 tonnes.\nTraders in Asia seemed largely uninterested in the Wednesday options expiry as China is seen to be flush with copper and not interested in selling.\nWhat little movement there has been out of China, some of which was possibly included in the 3,000-tonne hike in Singapore, was in small lots of probably no more than 1,000 tonnes at a time, the Shanghai trader said.\nWhile China was neither actively buying nor selling now, it would have to boost imports to keep pace with demand next year, traders said.\n\"The market is physically tight so it is very good for the producers,\" a marketing executive with a major producer said.\nHe said China's crackdown on scrap imports, coupled with expected casualties among domestic smelters, would lead to total Chinese copper imports in 1997 of 830,000 tonnes.\nThe opening in February or March of a new smelter in Anhui province near the top-of-the-line Tongling smelter would account for an increase over 1996, he said.\nOfficial customs figures show January to October 1996 imports of cast and unwrought copper were up 28.8 percent on 1995, to 549,571 tonnes, with October imports 82,655 tonnes.\nThe new smelter, a joint venture between Tongling and Japan's Itochu Corp and Sumitomo Corp had already booked 210,000 tonnes of concentrate imports for the year, the marketing executive said.\n\"They are looking at smelting 330,000 tonnes of concentrate, and producing 110,000 tonnes of metal,\" he said.\nIn other base metal markets, premiums to Hong Kong remained largely unchanged.

A European trader in Beijing said he had been offered copper by the China National Non-ferrous Metals Import and Export Corp (CNIEC) at around $2,100 a tonne -- a level reflecting the London Metal Exchange (LME) cash price plus a premium of $130.\nCNIEC has declined to comment on the market talk.\nThe copper was said to be owned by Chinese trading firms which had shipped it to Shanghai in the expectation that the central stockpile would buy this amount to square its position on metal previously lent to the market, before the end of 1996. \"They are hoping that it is the right tonnage in the right place, but as far as we know, the stockpile has so far not confirmed they will buy it,\" a Chinese trader with a state-owned Chinese firm, said.\nTraders said last week the copper probably belonged to China's state reserve, which lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper, through CNIEC, onto the LME between April and June 1995.\nIn March this year, CNIEC's former president Fang Dachang said China was likely to take it back in the fourth quarter.\nBut when copper began to move back to China in June and July, from LME warehouses in Rotterdam, Singapore and Long Beach, California traders assumed the central reserve was taking the copper back earlier than planned.\nNot so, said the Chinese trader, though he added: \"Who owns it is anyone's guess.\"\nThe metal was taken from LME warehouses at about $2,400 a tonne, a Hong Kong trader said, with the price set before three month LME copper prices slid below $1,800 on news in June of $1.8 billion in copper trading losses by Japan's Sumitomo Corp.\nThree month copper was indicated at $1,942/45 a tonne in late LME trade on Wednesday.\n\"It (the copper) has been sitting there for a couple of months, so someone has to pick up the loss,\" a trader said.\n\"Whether the stockpile takes this tonnage from this owner, or if they buy it themselves and arrange another shipment themselves, is up to them,\" the Chinese trader said.\n\"But it depends on the price. If they (the stockpile) can get a premium lower than $100, maybe they will take it. They won't pay $150, or $120, especially on this sort of tonnage.\"\nA trader in Shanghai said CNIEC would \"dearly love someone to take the whole lot, but that is unrealistic\".\nBut the Chinese source said: \"This copper can only be taken by the stockpile\" because no other buyer could afford it.\nChina levies a three percent import duty and a 17 percent value-added tax on copper imports, which traders said made it prohibitively expensive.\nFreight, warehousing and other costs would put the Shanghai copper in the same cost bracket as copper shipped to the region from LME warehouses in Europe or the Americas if the premiums being asked were paid, traders said.\nOther traders, in Asia and in Europe, have told Reuters that CNIEC had offered them copper in a series of secret meetings held in major Chinese cities since June.\nAbout 40,000 tonnes was said by traders in China to have been shipped already to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou, where the strategic stockpile has some warehouses. This has not been confirmed.\nAnother 20,000 tonnes of copper was stored in Shanghai Metal Exchange warehouses in the eastern port city, and the remainder of the metal was in other Shanghai stores, traders said.\n\"The whole market is still being manipulated by somebody,\" a Chinese source said. \"The game is not over.\"",

One source at a Chinese listed company said he had 200 tonnes of the red metal to sell at a premium of $100 over the LME spot price.\nThe premium on copper, CIF (cost, insurance and freight) to Hong Kong and Chinese ports, was $150 last week, traders said.\n\"We will not have any import business (with China) with such high LME prices,\" another trader in Hong Kong said. \"We are getting calls from Chinese offering copper back to the market.\"\n\"Premiums are not the issue, the total price is the concern -- and even with no premium it is difficult,\" he said.\nAmong the bears, the head of a trading house in Hong Kong bullishly noted signs the central government was attempting to stimulate the property market could see copper and aluminium users stocking up.\nCancellation of interest rate subsidies, interest rate reductions and the removal of private car purchase quotas were aimed at stimulating the sluggish economy, he said.\n\"I think the whole picture will change,\" he said.\n\"We have been waiting for a very long time and we have known they (Chinese authorities) are moving in this direction. It will restart cash flow and that will re-stimulate the economy very, very quickly,\" he said.\nHe and other traders said Chinese consumers' stocks, usually kept at one month's supply or around 100,000 tonnes, have been run down.\n\"Consumers have nothing and if they have to accumulate investory in their warehouses because of the change of sentiment, the damage to the market will disappear,\" he said.\nOther sources said the Shanghai Metal Exchange had around 15,000 tonnes of copper in stock.\nDrawdowns from LME warehouse stocks over the past couple of months indicated demand in Europe was picking up, traders said.\n\"If it continues, we will not have enough material, especially as there is no scrap around at the moment and LME stocks are down (to 145,825 tonnes),\" said the trading house boss.\n\"The situation could become critical by the end of the year,\" he said.",

It's too late. We had all expected one, but it has not come,\" Gennady Grigoryev, deputy head of Rosneft's financial-commercial directorate, said.\nThe Rosneft officials said Fuel and Energy Minister Pyotr Rodionov -- who had reiterated publicly as recently as last month that there would be a duty -- had failed to excite Kremlin officials with the idea.\n\"Rodionov was insisting on his position, but there are many corridors of power in Russia and he just did not score enough points with government officials to get them to agree to this,\" one of the Rosneft officials said.\nOne trader likened Rodionov's comments to \"a soldier's talk designed to pump people up and reflect his interests\".\n\"It's really possible it's true (that there will be no export duty),\" said a senior trader at a European company.\n\"But it comes a little too late to make me happy. I'm not thinking about mazut until May or so.\"\nRussian heavy fuel oil exports tail off sharply in the colder winter season from November to around May, as waterways and export outlets freeze and consumption increases at home.\nThe mazut export issue was a hot item of debate in government halls, with Rodionov's camp arguing for a tariff to bolster domestic supplies, and those against the proposal saying Russia needed fewer restrictions and more of a market economy.\nTraders are conditioned to expect a Russian heavy fuel oil export restriction.\nMoscow raised the export tariff on mazut to 16 Ecus per tonne from six Ecus during December 1995 to March 1996 to curb deliveries abroad. It banned mazut exports outright from December 1994 to April 1995.\n\"Russia has grown up,\" said one of the traders, adding that the decision not to levy a tariff was a triumph for Russia's new market-minded leaders over the old generation.\n\"I think there were a lot of people in the government who realised that such tariffs are just not advantageous.\"",

We are producing according to plan.\"\nNorilsk officials have for the first time in years declined to provide immediate total group production results for 1996 and 1997 forecasts.\nUneximbank press relations director Yuri Oleinikov said the group had slightly overfulfilled its plan to boost nickel output by three percent and copper output by six percent in 1996, but gave no absolute figures.\nThe group's 1995 nickel output was 180,100 tonnes, while its refined copper output was 338,700 tonnes.\nAbout one third of Norilsk's profits go to supporting social services in the expensive and vastly remote Far North, where four of the group's six key enterprises, including the flagship combine, are based.\n\"We want 1997 to be the year we stabilise, and we are doing a lot to make sure that this happens,\" Feldman said. \"But my position does not permit me to say this actually will happen.\"\nPotanin said Norilsk, if it did not agree to a share issue to raise capital, would be put in the hands of a special tax commission which could institute liquidation proceedings.\nOleinikov said he did not think a share issue would solve Norilsk's cash problems and called on the government to understand the logistics of producing metal in a frozen, inhospitable section of the globe.\n\"Our sector should have a strong state role because it is a core industry -- it supports people and, through its exports, the federal budget,\" Feldman said. \"Production will undoubtedly continue normally -- we take a lot of measures to ensure that.\nNorilsk ordinary shares had fallen 8.95 percent to $6.00 at 4.26 p.m.(1226 GMT) on the Russian Trading System.\n\"The state should understand that to demand too much is to cut into production,\" Oleinikov said. \"They will not want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.\"",

Moscow has promised but done little to let banks with special licences take gold abroad to secure financing.\nAnalysts said Moscow feared losing control of its gold industry, which would be harder to track than other key sectors.\n\"The history of the (Russian) industry is partly driven by politics, not economics,\" said analyst Andy Smith of Union Bank of Switzerland in London.\nOthers said a tug-of-war for control was scaring investors.\nThe Central Bank, which shares responsibility for gold reserves with the Finance Ministry, wants more control over more gold reserves to support the rouble in the future.\nBut Interfax news agency quoted Deputy Finance Minister German Kuznetsov as saying the ministry, not the Central Bank, should have first crack at buying output and the state, not the private sector, should finance most mining.\nTotal, unspecified volume of Russian gold mined over January-September was nine-percent below year-ago levels, the State Statistics Committee said. Mining season ends in October as freezing weather emerges in Siberia and Russia's Far East.\nAnd Russia will literally have to dig deep to tap its reserves. More than three quarters of Russian gold is in below-ground ore deposits.\nMore than half of all foreign-backed gold projects in the former Soviet Union are in Russia.\nBut none of the big ones, including the giant Sukhoi Log, the world's largest unmined reserve with a possible 1,800 tonnes, are at the production stage because of tax and royalty quibbles with the government.",

The role of Transneft has been a contentious issue among CPC members and a key negotiating point.\nBut the signing raised questions over how much closer CPC is to resolving differences and getting its pipeline project off the ground.\n\"We are extremely satisfied with the commercial structure that has been accomplished and we believe it offers a realistic approach to such an important project,\" said Chevron senior Vice-President Jeet Bindra.\n\"We are anxious now to move it to the next stage and hope that a share acquisition will be accomplished by February 1997 and that construction will begin next year.\"\nA raft of officials, including LUKoil President Vagit Alekperov, Kazakh Oil and Gas Minister Nurlan Balgimbayev, former Fuel and Energy Minister Yuri Shafranik, Deputy Fuel and Energy Minister Anatoly Shatalov, attended the signing.\nChevron spokesman Edward Chow said the two entities -- CPC Russia and CPC Kazakhstan -- would have an identical management structure.\nBut Russian Deputy Prime Minister Valery Serov said it had not yet been decided whether Transneft would acquire the Russian government's 24 percent stake in the consortium.\nChevron will own 15 percent in the CPC, Russia's LUKoil 12.5 percent, Mobil and Russia's Rosneft 7.5 percent each, British Gas Plc and Italy's Agip SpA two percent each, and Oryx Energy Company and Kazakhstan's Munaigaz 1.75 percent each.\nThe remaining 50 percent is divided between Russia (24 percent), Kazakhstan (19 percent) and Oman (seven percent).\nTransneft Chief Executive Officer Valery Chernayev told Reuters that the firm wanted Russia's entire 24 percent stake -- a demand that could delay the project even further.\nCPC, set up in 1992, is seeking to build a 1,580 km (990 mile) pipeline linking Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil field and Russia's Black Sea oil expot outlet Novorossiisk.\nChevron and Mobil, with a $20 billion oil project in Tengiz, are the main future customers of the CPC pipeline.\nOfficials signed the deal in a Moscow hotel conference area, but only after breaking out of negotiations repeatedly to run to corners of the room and consult.\n\"This concludes the first phase of the project,\" Serov said. \"Now a follow-up step, which will be no easier than what we accomplished today, must be made -- project implementation.\"\nCPC nominated Transneft as operator, but CPC sources said they had a stringent list of conditions Transneft had to agree to and fulfill if it wanted the role.\nSerov said Western firms bidding to construct the link would have to do so jointly with Russian or Kazakh partners and said the latter would be given preference as equipment suppliers.\n\"From our point of view, Transneft has been designated as an operator,\" Chevron's Bindra told Reuters, adding that the group must still negotiate an operating agreement.\n\"For three years, we failed to find a common language,\" Balgimbayev said, adding that he was pleased with the deal.\nThe pipeline will initially move 28 million tonnes a year (560,000 barrels per day) of Kazakh and possibly Russian crude and will have a peak capacity of 67 million tonnes a year (1.34 million bpd).",

ARS is the world's second largest diamond producer and its sales of uncut gems rose six percent in 1995 to $1.38 billion.\nARS, which mines nearly all of Russia's diamonds and is its sole official exporter, reached a preliminary agreement with De Beers' to export rough gems under a memorandum in February.\nBut the text of the agreement, undergoing review in various ministries, is awaiting government approval.\n\"The final agreement must correspond to the memorandum, since it was signed by the government and we are obliged to fulfil it,\" Kovylin said.\nThe prosecutor general's press service, which told Russian news agencies on Tuesday of the investigation, said it was investigating ARS' finances but stressed no formal criminal charges had been filed.\n\"At this point, there are no indictments,\" said press spokesman Natalya Vishnikova, declining to comment on whether formal charges would be pressed. \"We are investigating and the matter has been passed to the Federal Tax Inspectorate.\"\nThe investigations revolve around alleged unpaid taxes and breaches of hard currency regulations for which fines could total $379 million, according to Russian news agencies. The probe has generated further uncertainty over the relationship between Russia and De Beers.\n\"There's a whole lot of political infighting going on between Moscow and Yakutia,\" said analyst Roger Chaplin at T Hoare & Co in London, referring to the main diamond-producing region in Siberia where ARS is based.\n\"It could possibly affect the agreement with De Beers -- but then again, it could be somebody in Moscow trying to throw a spanner into the works.\"\nThe diamond world, recovering from the decision of Australian producer Argyle to say goodbye to De Beers, is impatiently waiting for Russia to finalise its relationship with the South African cartel.\nRussia has been accused in the past of leaking hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of diamonds on to world markets outside its previous deal with De Beers. The new deal, once approved by Moscow officials, could give De Beers greater control of Russian output.\nBut it may not give greater comfort to Russia's increasingly ambitious mineral-rich regions -- especially to Yakutia, which wants a greater cut from exports of rough gems.\nRussia-De Beers relations were first hit by uncertainty when Russia's Komdragmet, the precious metals and gems agency which participated in talks, was shut down by presidential decree in August.\nUnder the February memorandum, which replaced an expired five-year deal, De Beers would take about 85 percent of Russian rough diamonds. That is less than 95 percent under the previous deal, leaving Russia more for its own nascent cutting and polishing industry.",

I certainly wouldn't draw any conclusions that there have been a lack of negotiations or a termination of discussions.\"\nBoth Westbrook and Hazen declined to say when their projects could be finalised.\nWestern oil companies have a new worry -- the growing demands by oil-rich regions for a bigger cut in deals.\nInterfax news agency earlier this week quoted the chairman of the State Duma lower parliament house's Committee on Natural Resources as saying that the Nenets regional Duma had recommended the government break off talks with TPC over regional tax issues.",

Yarikhanov said financing could come from a Chechen cut in the transport fees that the Azeri oil consortium will pay to ship oil via Chechnya.\n\"We want our share of profits from the transport of oil across our country,\" he said, adding the Azeri group would pay $16.57 per tonne to send oil from its Caspian Sea platforms near Baku to Novorossiisk.\nThe Azeri oil consortium also includes Azeri state firm SOCAR, Amoco Corp, Pennzoil Co, Unocal Corp, Exxon Corp, Ramco Energy Plc, Russia's LUKoil, Turkish TRAO, McDermott International Inc, Itochu Corp and Saudi Arabia's Delta Nimir.\nThe Southern Oil Company, also called the Chechen Oil Company, had hoped to stabilise output at three to four million tonnes a year before the breakaway region descended into bloodshed.\nChechnya accounted for one-third of Soviet oil production in the 1970s, or around 22 million tonnes a year, before Moscow began tapping its massive Siberian reserves.\nRefining capacity in the south Caucasian region is 20-22 million tonnes a year, but operations have ceased.",

But he said Russian grains output, which has nearly halved in recent years, would not stage a comeback for at least another five or 10 years.\n\"There is just not enough feed grain in Russia -- we've got to produce more soymeal and maize,\" Alexander Vasyutin, deputy head of the Agriculture Ministry's crops growing section, said.\nRussia has been slaughtering livestock because it does not have enough grain to feed it. Bread is a staple in Russia but people are eating less and product quality is patchy.\nRussia's just-completed 1996 gross harvest was 74.6 million tonnes, according to preliminary official figures -- just eight percent above 1995's disastrous net 63.4 million tonnes, the worst since about 1965.\nAbout eight percent of the 1996 total will be lost after cleaning -- putting net output at about 68.6 million tonnes.\nSome analysts say up to 20 percent of Russia's harvest was lost in the Soviet era due to inefficient, obsolete combines, and that losses now, with even less money for adequate equipment, may still be severe.\n\"Next year, we'll see the same harvest we had this year, maybe a little more, maybe a little less,\" Yukish said. \"But to expect sharp increases in output next year is not realistic.\"\nIndustry officials said that with the domestic economy showing signs of turning around and a growing middle-class hungry for meat, Russia must act fast if it is to satisfy demand in the future.\nAlready the signs do not point to big increases next year.\nVasyutin said farmers, afraid of unseasonably warm, dry weather that has lasted into November across Russia's grain belt, had sown 1.2 million fewer hectares, or around 14.5 million hectares, to winter grains for harvesting in 1997.\n\"Crops are in a satisfactory condition, but moisture levels are not adequate,\" he said, adding government officials had targeted a 1997 harvest of at least 70 million tonnes.\"\nWinter wheat accounts for about 15 percent of Russian wheat output and can crucially tip the balance.\n\"Russians want to eat meat -- but this desire has to be preceeded by very serious structural changes in agriculture,\" Yukish said. \"Russia will be a big feed grains importer for quite a while -- of that I am quite sure.\"",

But analysts still wonder how much Russian aluminium could flood onto sensitive markets.\nAsked if Russia had learned anything from the March 1994 memorandum of understanding that reduced global output 10 percent to draw down bloated stocks, the senior London source said, \"It has not learned. I don't think they care.\"\nIgor Prokopov, director of Kontsern Alyuminiy, the producers' group uniting Russia's aluminium industry, said 1996 primary aluminium output would rise 1.5 percent from 1995 to 2.79 million tonnes.\nProduction could rise another 1.5 to 2.0 percent in 1997.\nThe group put Russian 1996 primary aluminium exports at 2.37 million tonnes, against what it said were 2.11 million in 1995.\n\"Some noise has appeared in the West that Russia has cranked things up, which is not really true,\" Prokopov said.\nBut two base metals analysts said the figures seemed on the low side and Russian smelters had undoubtedly increased output.\nBut they have done so while consolidating sales operations to try to make more money on exports, which has introduced more transparency into deliveries abroad.\nShareholders, many of them Western commodities power houses, were having a greater hand in that transparency, since they were increasingly buying direct from smelters.\nPechiney of France, Glencore AG of Switzerland and London-based powerhouse Trans-World Metals and its units already have major stakes in Russian smelters.\nAnalysts said the Bratsk smelter, the world's largest, with annual capacity of about 850,000 tonnes, had major plans to modernise with the help of a top European industrial firm.\nLME three-month aluminium futures are around $1,550 a tonne, clawing back from October's 2-1/2 year low of $1,305 but below a $2,195 in January 1995, the last major peak.\nPrices had been even lower before Russia and five other countries -- the United States, Canada, Australia, Norway and the European Union -- signed the 1994 accord. The five said Russia was to blame because it had flooded markets with metal.\nThose exports were largely orchestrated by the state, which needed cash to fill its coffers.\nNow smelters say they are reining in trade and marketing operations to be closer to markets in a way that Soviet-style ministries in Moscow were not.\n\"Integration could have a positive affect,\" Prokopov said, citing expense rationalisation and consolidated balances.\nRussia is an aluminium powerhouse because its Siberian smelters, which account for 90 percent of output, have endless, cheap hydroelectricity generated by rivers.",

Russia has more than one-third of world gas reserves and 26 percent of output, and is the world's single largest producer, with output of 556 bcm last year.\nGazprom accounts for 94 percent of Russian gas output and transports nearly all of it. The firm wants output to rise to 820 bcm a year by 2010.\nRussia exports only 20 percent of its output, and declining industrial consumption at home has left Russia with an oversupply. Europe is also flush with supplies, though demand is set to rise.\n\"The fact that Gazprom does not have its own financing for Yamal and that it has not been able to find domestic or foreign financing (for the main part of the project) speaks quite negatively about its economics,\" said the European source.",

There's no reason for the fall in prices,\" he said, citing lower world stocks.\nBut he said Russia's survival as an aluminium power was not in question, since the Siberian smelters, accounting for 90 percent of output, had captive, plentiful sources of hydroelectricity, a main cost in production.\nDepressed prices would be the motor for Russian smelters to consolidate operations as they completed their transition from state-run enterprises to market-nimble corporations.\n\"The Russian aluminium industry should be consolidated and act as a large transnational company like Alcoa or Pechiney,\" Prokopov said. \"We won't be like Gazprom,\" he said, referring to the natural gas monopoly. \"But there will be three or four teams that will act on world markets.\"\nThe process has already started. Siberian Aluminium, a so-called financial industrial group, includes Bratsk -- the world's biggest smelter -- and Sayansk, Trans-World Group, Zalogbank, and Kazakhstan's Pavlodar alumina plant.\nThe Krasnoyarsk smelter is in a group with the Achinsk alumina plant and wants to bring Ukraine's Nikolayevskiy alumina plant on board.\n\"Integration could have a positive affect,\" Prokopov said. \"It will lead to expense rationalisation, lower costs and consolidated balances. Smelters are in a satisfactory state, but we want better -- we want more resources to modernise them.\"",

        "Text": "Russian diamond giant Almazy- Rossii Sakha (ARS) said on Wednesday officials were battling for control over Russia's lucrative gem sector but a forthcoming deal with De Beers was in sight.\nARS president Vyacheslav Shtyrov told a news conference that a long-delayed trade agreement with the South African gem giant could be signed by December.\nBut he said Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who could have a chance to sign the deal as soon as this week, would put it off until next month because of a government probe of ARS's finances -- a probe Shtyrov says may be part of manoevres among government officials for influence over the group.\nThe investigation and struggle for control over ARS come as the diamond company seeks more scope to export independently of De Beers. ARS supplies a quarter of De Beers output, nearly all Russia's diamonds and is Russia's sole authorised exporter.\nShtyrov said that under the trade agreement with De Beers, based on a memorandum initialled in February, ARS would have the right to export $180 million of gems a year independent of De Beers, or 5.8 percent of ARS's $1.38 billion in sales last year.\nThat could yield a rich trove of influence and power for whichever government ministries succeed in gaining the upper hand in controlling those sales.\nARS, which gave London investment bank NatWest Markets a mandate in July to raise $500 million in capital, wants to increase exploration and mining operations -- giving officials more incentive to grapple for control of the state-owned firm.\n\"We're very seriously worried about the recent accusations, which come at, and I say this in quotation marks, at an appropriate moment,\" said Mikhail Nikolayev, president of the vast Sakha-Yakutia region in Siberia where ARS is based.\nHe told the news conference he was referring to the impending De Beers deal and to ARS's plan to raise funds abroad.\nThe probe, which follows charges from tax officials and the prosecutor-general's office that surfaced last week, revolve around alleged unpaid taxes and breaches of hard currency regulations for which fines could total $379 million.\nNikolayev said ARS had no tax arrears to the federal budget, and that Finance Ministry investigations into ARS finances turned up so-called insufficiencies but no major problems.\n\"They (the charges) are extremely debatable,\" said Shtyrov, adding that government questions over how to value raw gems supplied to ARS when the company was set up in 1991 were questions for accountants, not for lawyers.\nHe said ARS would defend itself in Russia's courts if it had to and restore its reputation with partners.\n\"If the result of all of this is that we lose our investment projects, then we will consider that Russia has lost -- and we will just eat bread and butter,\" he said.\nShtyrov, who is also vice-president of Sakha-Yakutia, said industry officials were struggling for influence over ARS.\nShtyrov said Yevgeny Bychkov, former head of the recently disbanded State Committee for Precious Metals and Stones, or Komdragmet, was still an influential figure in the industry.\nKomdragment was broken up by presidential decree in August and the Finance Ministry has assumed its functions.\nShtyrov said Russia's diamond sector would see stability, in spite of plans by some officials to give domestic cutters and polishers a greater cut of gem output.\n\"There are always rumours of a major shake-up and reorganisation of the Russian diamond industry, but they are not founded,\" he said.",

Most of the decline came from companies producing over 10 million tonnes a year.\n\"It is the ministry's opinion that output will fall two or three percent next year,\" said a Fuel and Energy Ministry source who declined to be named, saying that the matter was sensitive.\nThat would still be one of the lowest declines Russia's beleaguered oil industry has seen in recent years.\nIt would also be a sign that the era of steep plunges is finally drawing to a close.\nRussia's 1995 output of 305 million tonnes, or 6.2 million barrels per day, is stabilising at just over half of 1987's peak of 570 million tonnes (11.4 million bpd).\nThe numbers matter because they indicate the pace at which Russia, once the world's largest oil producer, may regain that place as its economy and domestic oil prices grow.\nBut it is still early.\n\"There are a lot of expectations that the barrier will be broken next year, but it won't -- output will be flat,\" said Tamara Okhundova, energy analyst at the Centre for Economic Trends, a research institute set up by the government.\nMoscow is for now committed to subsidising domestic oil prices to help flagging industrial enterprises, and export levels cannot rise significantly until new pipelines are built -- two key factors that do not inspire higher production levels.\n\"Production next year is going to be pretty flat, and if anything, slightly lower,\" said energy analyst Jeremy Hudson of Salomon Brothers in London.\nHe said that if parliament soon approved a list of reserves open to production-sharing, an initial, positive impact on output could be felt by the end of 1997.\nRussia's joint ventures, which account for less than five percent of production, are showing the biggest increases in output, with their production up 18 percent in the first half 1996 to seven million tonnes.\nWhen the big-ticket joint ventures and production-sharing deals begin producing in several years, total output could soar.\nA bull-run in world prices and Moscow's scrapped export duties have inspired Russian producers to put even more oil into already over-strapped export pipelines.\nBut a tax clampdown on high foreign-exchange earners and a lack of commitment by new shareholders in Russian oil companies to reinvest in production are both sucking up cash.\nJulian Leigh, Russia analyst at the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London, said higher export dollars were not necessarily finding their way back into production.\nHe said domestic commercial banks, some of which are major stockholders in big Russian oil companies, preferred to pump cash into markets with better returns, like equity.\nRehabilitating wells is one of the fastest and cheapest ways to boost output, but most of the easy, less expensive workovers have been completed and average well production rates have not been as high as expected.",

He said his company would spend at least 10 billion french francs ($1.9 billion) on TMM.\nFrench Finance Minister Jean Arthuis meanwhile reaffirmed that the government was set on selling defence and consumer electronics group Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe and Daewoo even if Prime Minister Juppe wanted a public debate on the sale of the state group.\nJuppe told parliament on Tuesday he would call a debate on the sale, for one symbolic franc, after an 11 billion franc ($2.2 billion) capital injection, in reaction to a public outcry and criticism from opposition parties and also from within his own coalition.\nArthuis dismissed criticism on the government's decision to sell the company by way of a private placement instead of a public sale.\n\"This is a company that could not be privatised through a public offer,\" Arthuis told reporters at a press briefing on Thursday. \"How could we ask several investors to bid on a company with a negative net value.\"\nThomson has debts of some 14 billion francs.\nLagardere wants to merge Thomson SA's 58-percent-owned and profitable defence group Thomson-CSF with its Matra unit and sell loss-making consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia (TMM) to Daewoo Electronics.\nThe state's Privatisation Commission is currently studying both the preferred bid by Lagardere/Daewoo and one by Alcatel Alsthom and is expected to give its opinion in early December.\nThe chairman of Daewoo Electronics said his company would spend at least 10 billion francs on TMM in an effort to still the rising criticism about the deal.\n\"In total, the immediate cost of acquisition and recapitalisation of Thomson Multimedia for Daewoo is some 10 billion francs. But these 10 billion are only a first stage,\" Bae Soon-hoon told the La Tribune Desfosses newspaper, breaking his self-imposed silence on Daewoo's bid details.\nHe said South Korea and France had increasingly direct links, adding that French companies had sold the TGV high-speed train and nuclear power stations to his country and were planning to sell battle planes and other weapons.\nFrance's trade minister Yves Galland is due to travel to South Korea on Monday to promote the country's economic interests during a trip lasting until Thursday.\nFrance hopes to sell Dassault Rafale combat planes to South Korea to monitor its northern Communist neighbour.\nKim Woo-choong, chairman and founder of the Daewoo conglomerate, told France's Liberation newspaper in Seoul that big Japanese companies would want to see the Thomson deal fail.\n\"Certain big international electronics companies are against ths deal because they believe that the merger would make Daewoo too competitive,\" Woo-choong said, adding, \"These big companies are perhaps busy lobbying the French government.\"\nLiberation said he referred to Japanese companies.\n\"The French government cannot come back on its decision if there is not an important reason to do so,\" Woo-choong said.",

Lagardere plans to merge its Matra unit with Thomson-CSF and sell TMM to Daewoo -- also for one franc.\n\"The public authorities focused on the military aspect of the Thomson deal. They neglected the civilian (consumer electronics) aspect...it's now sticking in their throats,\" said the newsletter La Lettre de l'Expansion.\nA survey of 1,004 voters published by the newspaper La Tribune found 72 percent disapproved of the sale price, saying it did not reflect TMM's value. Only 12 percent agreed with the government that the price was right given the group's debts.\nTMM is saddled with the bulk of Thomson's debt, expected to reach 28 billion francs ($5.44 billion) by the end of the year.\nLoser Alcatel broke its silence on Friday and said it would not have sold control of TMM to a foreign group but put together a 50-50 joint venture with an Asian partner.\n\"This new group would have formed the basis of a global industrial project in which French interests would have been solidly represented,\" Alcatel said in a statement.\nThe deal hinges on the approvals of France's Privatisation Commission and the European Commission, and speculation is rising that the privatisation commission -- which had been expected to make only a procedural review -- may turn into a more serious stumbling block.\nThe commission, a body of seven independent experts chaired by Pierre Laurent, has the mandate to ensure that any deal reflects the value of the company.\n\"Of course, they can disagree with the government,\" a Finance Ministry official said. \"If they agree, the deal can go ahead. If they disagree, the privatisation procedure has to be started over again,\" he added.",

This is mainly done through the Global One joint venture with Deutsche Telekom and Sprint Corp of the United States.\nSecondly, the group wants to use its know-how in building modern infrastructure networks and is setting up such networks in Latin America and Indonesia.\nThirdly, the group is looking for \"new growth areas\" to compensate for the impact on sales of the new competition in France, Bon said.\nMobistar, in which France Telecom has a majority stake, is part of this policy. The Beglian operator started six weeks ago and has 20,000 subscribers, aiming for a 25 percent market share in 2005.\nFrance Telecom hopes to hear in November that a consortium it leads has won a GSM licence in Romania and the group is in negotiations with the government of Poland.\nIn Poland, France Telecom is operator of an analogue network but was excluded from getting a GSM digital licence. After a state visit by French President Jacques Chirac, the situation has improved for France Telecom, but negotiations are still continuing.\nIn Italy, France Telecom has no ambitions in mobile telecommunications, because of the presence of state-owned TIM Omnitel, which is run by Olivetti.\nFrance Telecom is talking with Olivetti about co-operating in Infostrada, a fixed-line venture which is bidding for the network of the Italian railways.",

The operating licence sets technical standards, privacy issues and interconnection obligations.\nThe SNCF licence is the second such licence for a so-called \"alternative infrastructure\" in France. The first, for Eurotunnel unit TransManche to offer telecom links between London and Paris, was granted late last month.\nA spokesman for the ministry said that \"in the next few days\" licences would be granted to MFS Communication Co of the U.S. and Colt Telecom Group of Britain, owned by financial group Fidelity Investments.\nMFS and Colt will specialise on business networks in highly-populated areas but the SNCF licence covers the railroads' existing network of 8,000 kilometres of optic fibre all over the country, as well as radio links, which will be expanded to some 12,000 kilometres in the next six years, SNCF sources said.\nThe licence also allows Telecom Developpement to use other means beyond its own network.\nSNCF aims to decide before the end of the year which company will operate the network. It has at least three offers from interested companies.\nOne is from CEGETEL, the Generale des Eaux unit in which British Telecommunications Plc and Mannesmann of Germany have a stake and which aims to become France's second biggest operator.

One is that a Japanese distributor has gone bankrupt, which could cost the company money, and the other is that the roadshow is going badly,\" a share dealer said.\nSalomon was down 17 francs, or 3.83 percent, at 427 francs at 1141 GMT after having given in 26 francs on Wednesday.\n\"In fact one of our distributors in Japan, Olympic Sports Co has gone bankrupt. But that is already in the first half figures and it will not change anything on the group level,\" Salomon spokeswoman Linda Champtenois told Reuters.\nOlympic Sports applied for court mediation with creditors on September 20 with debts of 34.83 billion yen and the Japan Securities Dealers Association (JSDA) cancelled the company's Over-the-Counter registration.\nSalomon's Champtenois said that \"everybody knows about the difficult market for winter sport equipment in Japan\" and brushed off the effect on Salomon's results.\nMeanwhile Salomon's Japanese subsidiary Salomon & Taylor Made Co was trading in Tokyo at 810 yen, just above its life low of 790 yen and far below its year high of 1,790 yen. It was introduced on the OTC market in November 1995 at 1,800 yen.\nOn November 5, the Japanese unit reduced its parent six-months net results forecast to 288 million yen from 620 million yen and a comparable figure of 556 million.\nChamptenois said that the roadshow in London had been long planned, followed on a September 30 visit to Edinburgh and was \"going fine\".\nFrench dealers said that even if the rumours were unfounded and the Japan effect limited, they were a catalyst for profit-taking, especially now that the French market has hit a year high at a level not seen since in 1994.\nSalomon has been a stock market darling. From a low of 171.50 francs on March 14 in 1995, Salomon rose to an all-time high of 494 francs on October 22 this year.\nOn October 30, it said its first half sales to end September, at constant currency rates, rose by 21.8 percent to 2.021 billion francs.\nWhile hiking equipment -- walking boots and mountain gear -- was up by 68 percent and the Taylor Made golf equipment brand had a 77 percent increase in sales. Winter equipment, however, was down 16 percent. The Mavic cycle brand was up 4.1 percent.\nSalomon had earlier forecast that its operating results for the 1996/97 year would be stable due to the cost of further diversification into snowboards with the aqcuisiion of Bonfire and the planned launch of new boards, shoes and fixtures in 1997 as well as new roller skates in 1998.\nIn the year to March 1996, Salomon made a net attributable profit of 308 million francs against 161 million last year.",

Glotin said that the final make-up of CEGETEL's sharecapital would be known by year-end but he said it would be very close to the October agreement with BT taking 25 percent, SBC 15 percent and Mannesmann 10 percent.\n\"Changes are within the five percent limit,\" he said.\nGlotin said that the success of CEGETEL, or any other rival to France Telecom in France, depended to a large extent on the interconnection costs and other payments telecom operators have to make to France Telecom to use its installations.\nTelecommunications minister Francois Fillon has started a wide consultation, set to end on November 30, in order to establish in early 1997 a price list of the services France Telecom can provide to its rivals.\n\"The level of the interconnection costs for us means either the right to live of the right to die,\" Glotin said.\nAnother future rival to France Telecom is building and communications group Bouygues which has teamed up with Italy's STET.",

He denied newspaper reports that there was a 1400 GMT deadline for the bids.\n\"Bids have to be in today. That can be this afternoon or this evening. We are not going to close the mailbox,\" Leveque said.\nHe said the court would on Tuesday afternoon at the earliest make a statement about the bid or bids. After that it would study the offers.\n\"According to the law we have six months to study the situation. But it is clear that the company's cash position cannot hold another six months,\" he said.\n\"We will do all we can but the court cannot decide in 48 hours,\" Leveque said, adding a decision was due at the start of next week at the earliest.\nBritish Airways is preparing a bid for the regional airline, proposing to merge it with its French TAT unit.  \nA spokesman for British Airways in London said the company feared the French government would like a French company to acquire Liberte to prevent BA or another foreign airline from obtaining the carrier and its valuable slots at Orly airport.\nAir Liberte owns between 20 and 25 percent of the slots at Orly, Paris' second largest airport specialising in domestic routes, which represents 20,000 take-offs and landings per year.\nAir Liberte lost 650 million francs in the first nine months of 1996 and has debts of 1.5 billion francs. The company was placed under bankruptcy protection on September 26 after merger talks with other French airline AOM failed.  \nJacques Maillot, head of French travel company Nouvelles Frontieres and charter airline Corsair, said he planned to bid for both Air Liberte and AOM.\nAOM, formerly Air Outre-Mer, is being put on sale by the state agency Consortium de Realisation (CDR) which is divesting former Credit Lyonnais assets.\nRichard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic, said last week he might also bid for Air Liberte if BA did so. But a Virgin executive told Le Monde on Monday that the company was not yet sure whether a bid for Air Liberte was the best way to develop its business in France.  \nAir Liberte is owned 32.3 percent by Groupe Rivaud. Banque Indosuez has 13 percent, International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) 12 percent, Euralair 10 percent, Club Mediterranee has 8.5 percent, Lyonnaise de Banque 6.2 percent and SAE five percent.\nChairman and founder Lotfi Belhassine has six percent and other interests have the remaining seven percent.\nAir Liberte expanded its network rapidly in the past year, making full use of the opening up of the big national routes such as Paris-Marseilles, Paris-Toulouse, Paris-Nice and Paris-Bordeaux.\nAir France unit Air Inter, renamed Air France Europe, previously had a monopoly over these routes.\nAir Liberte, AOM, Eurolair, BA's TAT and others cut their prices in order to win market share on the routes prior to the complete opening up of the French -- and European -- air market in 1997.\nBut Air Liberte was unable to fill its planes and posted losses. The company also claimed it suffered from a forced regrouping of its activities to Orly Sud terminal, while Air France and Air France Europe remained based in Orly Ouest.",

But we will continue with improving our product and service while cutting our costs and prices,\" she said.\nBA, one of the world's most profitable airlines, will in first instance manage its French assets from a distance.

Such a meeting is due within a month.\nBut the way to the finishing line is not without obstacles.\nIn Brussels, Richard Branson's Virgin Express said it planned to raise its bid for Air Liberte, in administration since September 26. The court-appointed administrator, Maitre Baronnie, reacted sceptically.\n\"I have never seen any bid by Virgin so I do not see how they can increase a bid,\" he told Reuters by telephone.\n\"Strictly theoretically, a new bid could be made just up to the moment that the creditors meet and accept the offer on the table.

Otherwise, there will not be any French competition because there will be no French air transport industry left,\" the SNPL pilots union said in a statement.\nAir France is constrained from expanding in France until 1997, under conditions imposed by the European Commission for state rescue capital injections.\nAir Inter dominated French domestic routes and Orly airport until as recently 1995 when the French government decided to open some major domestic routes to competition ahead of full liberalisation from April 1997.\nA spokesman for Air Inter, now renamed Air France Europe, said the company had at the moment a 60 percent share on the total French market.\nDomestic airlines Air Liberte, AOM and TAT have all tried to carve out market share ahead of liberalisation with a price war.

Lagardere plans to merge its Matra unit with Thomson-CSF and sell TMM to Daewoo -- also for one franc.\n\"The public authorities focused on the military aspect of the Thomson deal. They neglected the civilian (consumer electronics) aspect...it's now sticking in their throats,\" said the newsletter La Lettre de l'Expansion.\nA survey of 1,004 voters published by the newspaper La Tribune found 72 percent disapproved of the sale price, saying it did not reflect TMM's value. Only 12 percent agreed with the government that the price was right given the group's debts.\nTMM is saddled with the bulk of Thomson's debt, expected to reach 28 billion francs ($5.44 billion) by the end of the year.\nLoser Alcatel broke its silence on Friday and said it would not have sold control of TMM to a foreign group but put together a 50-50 joint venture with an Asian partner.\n\"This new group would have formed the basis of a global industrial project in which French interests would have been solidly represented,\" Alcatel said in a statement.\nThe newspaper Les Echos said in an unsourced report on Monday that Alcatel had also pledged to transfer to the state any capital gain on the sale of part of TMM.\nThe deal hinges on the approvals of France's Privatisation Commission and the European Commission, and speculation is rising that the privatisation commission -- which had been expect to make only a procedural review -- may turn into a more serious stumbling block.\nThe commission, a body of seven independent experts chaired by Pierre Laurent, has the mandate to ensure that any deal reflects the value of the company.\n\"Of course they can disagree with the government,\" a Finance Ministry official said. \"If they agree, the deal can go ahead. If they disagree, the privatisation procedure has to be started over again,\" he added.",

Lagardere will keep 60 percent of Thomson Matra while the French state will have a golden share to safeguard national security interests.\nLagardere will sell Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics of South Korea.\nThe government said Daewoo was a well known investor in France and had knowledge of mass production techniques. Daewoo has made commitments on jobs -- creating 3,000 new jobs in France -- technology and investments.\nThomson Multimedia management will remain French-based.\nArthuis said the European Commission would have to approve the cash injection and study competition issues. He said the sale would take place before the end of the year and the cash for the injection would come from other privatisations.\nThe independent privatisation commission, which has an important say in the sale of state assets, still has to give its advice on the sale. Arthuis said the government had not wanted to keep its choice secret, as would have been usual, until the privatisation commission's advice \"to avoid insider trading\".\nThe decision was a surprise as markets and the media had gambled Alcatel's no-nonsense chairman Serge Tchuruk would take the prize over self-made entrepreneur Jean-Luc Lagardere, 69, who is preparing to hand over power to his son, Arnaud.\nLagardere also owns publishers Hachette and Filipachi.\nThomson SA lost 1.379 billion francs in 1995 and has 25 billion francs of debt.

It can still take some time before we have a contract,\" Campbell McGarvie, vice-president Europe, Africa and Midle East, said in an interview.\nHe gave no financial details of the Swedish deal.\nStorageTek, based in Louisville, Colorado, specialises in the storage and retrieval of digital information and increasingly is moving away from digital documents to bit-map images. Bit-map images are digital pictures. Bit-map images open up the possibility of storing medical scans or video images. Potential users of StorageTek's new products are members of the medical profession or broadcasters.\nStorageTek has disc-based products as well as tape-based products. In tape, it makes products for such companies as Siemens and Cie des Machines Bull.\nOn August 19, the company signed a deal with AT&T Corp's NCR unit under which NCR will market its Timberwolf tape system, a system for storing information.\nBut the NCR deal is less far reaching than a June 10 deal with International Business Machines Corp under which StorageTek will make IBM branded products.\nThe U.S. Justice Department is investigating the deal and in particular is looking at the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the direct-access storage devices industry. Pending completion of the probe, the deal cannot be finalised. Earlier this month, both StorageTek and IBM have said the inquiry was routine and expected.\nFinancial analysts say that, should the deal go through, it could add hundreds of millions of dollars to StorageTek's revenues.\n\"That was a major deal, it was big change for IBM. Never before had IBM allowed another company to build such major components as storage facilities,\" McGarvie said.\nAccording to the IDC research buro, StorageTek had an 11 percent share of the disc-based storage market in the first quarter of 1996 while IBM had a 30 percent stake.\nShould the deal go through, the two companies would hold just under half of the market, estimated for 1997 at 3,500 terrabytes (one thousand mega bytes), valued at $3.5 billion. The combined market share could grow to more than 50 percent in the next few years.\nEMC Corp is currently market leader with 43 percent, and Japan's Hitachi Ltd Hitachi Data has a share of over 11 percent.\n\"The deal is mutually exclusive. IBM will also fund our research and while we begin with the Iceberg product it will also involve new products,\" McGarvie said. The Iceberg, a StorageTek product, is a storage system for discs.\nStorageTek's Toulouse facility in France, opened in June 1995, will make IBM-branded products and the deal is expected to speed up the unit's expansion.\nAt Toulouse, some 100 people work on manufacturing and research and development. Storagetek is committed to increase this to 470 people within four years and McGarvie said that this would now easily be met, probably sooner than in four years.\nIn the medical imaging and video market, StorageTek sees a lot of opportunities but for the moment it has not yet signed big deals. \"We are in discussions for some deals which could be concluded next year,\" French marketing manager Eric Debray said.\nOn a horizon of five to 10 years, McGarvie believes the company could reap benefits from the Internet and Intranet online network services, coupling its storage facilities to online retrieval systems.\nStorageTek acquired the company Network Systems about a year ago. This company offers network solutions as well as security products such as Borderguard, which is a \"firewall\" products.\nA firewall shields sensitive internal computer information from the public internet and aims to prevent hackers from breaking into commercially vital information data bases.\n\"It's one of the main worries at the moment. Many companies want to go on the net but they fear that they will open up their internal systems to possible intrusion,\" McGarvie said.",

        "Text": "The former long-time head of Britain's General Electric Plc said in a newspaper interview on Wednesday the group was ready to deal with whoever won ownership of state-owned Thomson SA.\nThe comments to the Les Echos newspaper by Lord Weinstock, GEC's chairman emeritus since September, followed a statement by Alcatel Alsthom chairman Serge Tchuruk that he was ready to make a new offer for the state electronics group if a December 31 validity deadline for current offers passes.\nTchuruk added he was willing to adjust his company's bid to recent developments and suggested the state might want to spread the privatisation of Thomson SA out over time.\nIn October, the French government decided to sell Thomson SA for one franc to Lagardere Groupe after a 11 billion franc ($2.1 billion) cash injection, instead of to Alcatel.\nThis decision awaits approval of the European Commission (EC) as well as France's Privatisation Commission.\nWhile the EC decision could be due in the first half of December, the Privatisation Commission will not render its decision until after the Brussels' stance is known.\nThe French Finance Ministry has conceded that the entire operation may not be finished before December 31, a date after which theoretically both the Lagardere and Alcatel bids expire.\nThe announcement of a possible new Alcatel bid caused a slide in the company's shares, down 1.5 percent at 455.20 francs at midday, because investors did not like the new uncertainty.\nLagardere plans to merge Thomson's 58 percent-owned defence unit Thomson-CSF with its Matra Defence Espace unit while selling consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics of South Korea for one franc.\nThe second sale has caused a public outcry and thousands of Thomson employees have protested in France's main cities, fearing for their jobs and severe Korean working conditions, despite job creation promises by Daewoo.\nA group of Thomson workers in the western town of Angers are currently walking to Paris in a protest action, aiming to arrive in the capital in time for a December 6 shareholders meeting.\nPart of Alcatel's plans were to combine the Thomson-CSF business with its own defence activities and then merge these with GEC's Marconi to create a defence electronics giant.\nWeinstock said that neither Lagardere's plan to merge Matra with Thomson-CSF, nor Alcatel's defence activities with Thomson-CSF, would give spectacular effects.\n\"Only a merger between Thomson-CSF and Marconi would produce the necessary economies of scale and a good combination of products,\" he said, adding the combined company would have about $11 billion of annual sales.\nAlcatel had said it intended to find a European industrial partner for Thomson-CSF. While the company has long standing links with GEC through GEC-Alsthom, Tchuruk did not want to exclude a link with Germany's Deutsche Aerospace.\nIn a statement, Foreign Affairs minister Herve de Charette formally denied his staff would have handed a report to President Jacques Chirac about an alleged dinner conversation between Weinstock and GEC chief executive George Simpson in which they allegedly planned to seize control of the new defence grouping.\nWeinstock told Les Echos such a conversation had not taken place but said a report which contained a summary of the alleged conversation existed.\n\"Yes, that report exists and has been very damaging for the Alcatel position, people told us,\" Weinstock said.",

        "Text": "Cie Generale des Eaux on Tuesday launched its bid to become the main rival to state-owned France Telecom with the start a fixed telephone network in a residential quarter in the southern city of Nice.\nPhilippe Glotin, managing director of Generale's telecoms unit Cegetel, said the group aims to have a market share in 2003 yielding 40 billion francs ($7.9 billion) in annual sales, of which more than half would come from mobile communications.\nIn mobile telecommunications, Generale already competes with France Telecom with its SFR unit and it is allied to British Telecom Plc and MCI for business services.\nSFR expects to have one million customers by March 1997, Glotin said.\nThe local residential market is expected to grow at a moderate pace but nevertheless represent 55 billion francs in 2003.\nGlotin said he aimed at gaining a 40 percent share in mobiles, 20 percent in long-distance and 10 percent for so-called local loops, or small networks.\nCegetel, which counts BT, Mannesmann and SBC of the United States among its owners, has received permission from the French authorities for a telecoms experiment in Nice and from the start of 1997 it will offer residential telecoms services, using the DECT technology.\nDECT, digitally-enhanced cordless telephone, uses radio waves to connect buildings to a telephone switch, while the connections inside the building are of the classical type using a telephone socket.\nDECT is also available in totally wireless versions but the Nice experiment will not use this. DECT can handle high capacities and is relatively secure as far as privacy of calls is concerned.\nGlotin said that Nice was the precursor of Cegetel's assault on France Telecom and the company would invest three billion francs in Nice and Paris to hone its skills ahead of market liberalisation in 1998. The Paris service is expected to be ready in 1998.\nCegetel is aiming to start its business in some 30 towns which will add up to a population of some 10 million inhabitants.\nTo part finance this five-year plan, Cegetel shareholders will inject 6.8 billion francs into the company at the start of 1997.\nIn business services, Cegetel is considering putting a local loop in the La Defense office complex on the Paris outskirts -- where parent Generale des Eaux is the main building developer.\nIn that area, MFS Communications Ltd already offers business services with a local loop in competition to France Telecom.\nGlotin said that the success of Cegetel, or any other rival to France Telecom in France, depended to a large extent on the interconnection costs and other payments telecom operators have to make to France Telecom to use its installations.\nTelecommunications minister Francois Fillon has started a wide consultation, set to end on November 30, in order to establish in early 1997 a price list of the services France Telecom can provide to its rivals.\n\"The level of the interconnection costs for us means either the right to live of the right to die,\" Glotin said.\nOther future rivals for France Telecom are building and communications group Bouygues which has teamed up with Italy's STET. Bouygues started France's third mobile telecommunications service earlier this year.\nAT&T has also expressed a desire to become a major force in the French market.",

We were really budgetting for an economy that was stretching a touch but it doesn't look like it's going to do it,\" Jackson said.  \nJackson said in an interview the 1996 profit would be similar to calendar 1995's net profit of A$15.9 million.\n\"I think it's going to be much the same figure,\" he said.\nJackson cited the flat Australian economy, relatively weak automotive sales world-wide and the cost of developing new projects as the major constraints on short-term profit growth.\nBut he said the domestic economy should pick up in 1997 and put the group on track to achieving its goal of 15 to 20 percent annual growth in sales and earnings before interest and tax.  \nBut Jackson, speaking after the announcement of a A$200 million, five-year contract to supply brake parts to a North American vehicle manufacturer, seemed to be more concerned about coping with rapid growth than with a sluggish local economy.\nPacific BBA, which makes car parts, plastic packaging and construction products, has budgeted to spend around A$60 million in 1996 in capital expenditure, Jackson said.\n\"I think it (capital expenditure) will be two to three times depreciation (charges) for the next year or so,\" he said, adding that this was around twice the average for manufacturers.  \nThe group is examining a range of expansion opportunities in Asia and North America, requiring annual capital investments of between as little as A$5 million and A$200 million.\n\"We have people looking full time at these opportunities,\" he said. But the group must expand cautiously, he added.\n\"We've just got to be careful we don't over-stretch ourselves,\" he said. \"Growth holds back your short-term earnings,\" he added.\nJackson rued the failure of Pacific BBA's recent bid for fellow Australian manufacturer Azon Ltd, which was acquired instead by U.S.-based Illinois Tool Works Inc.  \nPacific BBA needs to become bigger or find a big partner to seize major new opportunities, especially in the automotive industry where the group wants to become a global niche player, he said.\nAsked if its small size in world terms could become a brake on Pacific BBA's growth, Jackson said: \"It's not been yet, but it could become one and we were trying to say to the market when we were trying to buy Azon that this could give us the ability to do anything we want to.\"",

It has maintained double-digit growth in net profit for all but four of the past five years.\nDespite the current downturn, it has continued to expand its offshore operations, buying 51 percent of Belgian UCB SA's flexible packing unit in May for about A$200 million.\nIt has also allocated A$380 million to expand paper production in Australia, where it commands about 40 percent of the market for fine papers.  \nMorgan's Clifford said he believed these and other capital investments -- totalling A$1.5 billion over the past two and a half years -- would begin to bolster the bottom line in 1997/98.\n\"These sorts of programmes will certainly come through with increased profits through 1998 (1997/98) and especially through 1999 (1998/99),\" Clifford said.\n\"The four to five-year outlook is pretty strong,\" he added.",

Coles has recently been among the most poorly performed listed retailers and is embarking on a major refocusing of its sprawling businesses.  \nOfficial data released on Tuesday showed that all areas of retailing except for food weakened in the three months to November and that overall retail sales continued to trend down despite two interest rate cuts since July.\nThe Reserve Bank eased rates again last month, but it was too late to rescue a second dismal Christmas for retailers.\n\"A shocker\" was how one stock analyst summed up the festive season for the clothing retailers, but she said supermarket chain Woolworths Ltd and other food retailers should have come through the Christmas period relatively unscathed.  \nAsked about the outlook for full-year profits in 1996/97, the analyst said: \"Pretty grim.\" But she and another analyst said they saw a pick-up in earnings in coming months.\n\"I think the outlook is reasonable, but not spectacular,\" the second analyst said.",

BHP shares have also rebounded, closing on Monday at A$17.31 after hitting A$15.58 in September.\n\"It's one of the few companies where analysts are revising the results upwards,\" said a fund manager's share analyst.\nThe five analysts contacted by Reuters on Monday gave widely varying forecasts for interim profit, ranging from A$715 million to a high of A$804 million. The analyst tipping A$715 million said he believed others had forecast even lower numbers.  \nBut the analysts agreed the interim result would show signs of improved performance in copper and steel, though they would fine tune their estimates after seeing the group's November production data, expected to be released on Tuesday.\n\"They have definitely had a good two quarters in petroleum and I guess they're struggling in minerals and copper and steel,\" a Melbourne-based analyst said.\n\"They are doing a good job given the environment.\"\nMost analysts said they expected a modest profit recovery for full year 1996/97. BHP reported a 20 percent drop in pre-abnormal net profit of A$1.29 billion in 1995/96.  \nBHP Petroleum, which in the first half of 1995/96 ranked behind the minerals and steel divisions in terms of profit, will be BHP's biggest earner in the interim result to be released on Friday, said JB Were and Son analyst Neil Goodwill.\n\"The asset sales are in there though,\" he said.\nThe analysts expect BHP to book between A$80 million and A$117 million in asset sales as operating profit, due in effect to gains on the sale of BHP's stake in the Mungo/Monan oil and gas fields in the North Sea and of its interest in the Sierra Chata gas field and Chihuidos block in Argentina.  \nBHP also made a A$45 million profit from the sale of its 20 percent stake in an undeveloped gold prospect, Sun Prospecting and Mining Co Ltd, in South Africa. But this was offset by the A$45 million loss booked on the sale of its Mali gold assets.\nBHP will not book any of these asset sales as abnormal items, deeming them too small to be taken below the line, one analyst said. But another analyst confessed he initially felt they were being taken above the line to mask the core result.  \n\"I thought that was the case and then the oil price shot up and copper is a bit better, so without that number (for asset sales) they would have had a reasonably good profit number anyway,\" he said.\nBHP's Magma Copper operation should creep back into profit in the second quarter after posting a loss on a full-cost basis in the first quarter results, he said.\nBHP bought Magma last January for US$2.4 billion, making it the world's second biggest copper producer. But the price tag has come under heavy criticism.  \nBHP is expected to book a net abnormal gain of around A$100 million from the settlement of its dispute with the Victoria state government over a federal tax on Bass Strait gas revenues.",

        "Text": "Australia's century-old steel maker, The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (BHP), has been warned it risks falling behind global rivals unless it restructures its big, ageing plants and maps out a clear offshore strategy.\nBHP Steel's long-term strategy came under the spotlight on Monday after credit rating agency Standard and Poor's wrote in a steel industry review that BHP faced its toughest test yet as it positioned itself to tackle rapidly developing Asian markets.\nS&P's comments, made in the latest edition of its journal CreditFocus, comes as Taiwan's An Feng Steel Co Ltd plans to build a A$1.4 billion steel mill in Australia in what has been termed a \"wake-up call\" for BHP.\n\"A wake-up call is not a bad way of looking at it,\" a corporate analyst told Reuters, describing the competition to supply steel into Asian economies as intense.\n\"It's not that they (BHP) have been flat-footed; it's just that there are (bigger) global players out there with billions of dollars to set these things up,\" he added.\nAn Feng and its little known minority Australian partner, Kingstream Resources NL, launched last Friday a plan to build a new-technology steel mill expected to produce annually 2.4 million tonnes of steel slab for mainly Asian consumption.\nThe move has been seen as a direct challenge to BHP, which dominates the Australian market with steel products made from old-technology plants on the country's east and south coasts. The youngest of its three big steel mills opened 56 years ago. These old mills also supply raw steel for BHP's more modern offshore operations, which have so far focused on downstream steel mills in Asia making higher-value products tailored for such industries as car-making and construction.\nBHP produces 636 tonnes of steel per worker per year using predominantly coal-fired blast furnaces, but by the year 2000 new-technology mills using electric arc furnaces will enable steel operators to reach 1,000 tonnes per worker, S&P said.\n\"In many respects, BHP Steel's future earnings quality will depend on the successful implementation of this international growth strategy and the critical selection of steel-making technology for future domestic expansion,\" S&P analyst Brad Scott wrote in the January edition of CreditFocus.\nBHP is expected by May to announce the results of a year-long review of the steel division's long-term strategy, begun last year after the group reported a dive in steel profits and a big writedown of its Newcastle mill near Sydney.\nBHP has since indicated it is prepared to close the 81-year-old Newcastle mill if need be.\nSpeculation about the closure of Newcastle, and with it the loss of thousands of jobs, has prompted a parliamentary inquiry into the future of Australia's steel industry -- virtually a synonym for BHP, which supplies 75 percent of the local market.\nBHP's local dominance and its production costs, still low in global terms, will give it some comfort over the next few years, but the so-called \"Big Australian\" must rationalise its assets at home to realise its long-term goals in Asia, analysts said.\n\"BHP will need to define its domestic investment vision over that period or risk falling behind the competitiveness of its global competitors,\" S&P's Scott said.\nA stock analyst suggested BHP may even resolve to abandon raw-steel making capacity and begin buying it instead from cheaper producers, but a BHP Steel spokesman doubted this.\n\"I would not see that,\" spokesman John Devers told Reuters. \"We have got the benefits of relatively low-cost raw materials on our doorstep and good transport arrangements and energy.\"",

Another analyst disappointed with the result said the resources giant was still on track for a modest profit recovery for the full year to May 31, 1997.\nThough forecast signs of improvement emerged in BHP's battered copper division, with the North American copper operations swinging back into profit, analysts had been tipping a first-half group pre-abnormal result of around A$760 million.\nBHP's pre-abnormal net profit of A$683 million was 15.8 percent down on the corresponding 1995/96 period.\nBut managing director John Prescott said the second quarter figures showed an accelerating improvement in performance and that, despite weak copper and steel prices, the group was still investing in future growth.\nCiting a sharp jump in exploration expenditure in the half year, he told reporters: \"That's an important part of sustaining our growth.\"\n\"I think we are moving ahead,\" he added. \"We have a lot of work to do and we're going to build the company around its high-quality assets and we are starting to see the results of our work.\"\nIncluding abnormals, BHP's minerals, copper and steel divisions all contributed higher earnings in the latest three months against the August quarter. The steel division was flat.\nPetroleum was the biggest earner with A$253 million for the quarter, but this included an abnormal gain of A$107 million from the settlement of a dispute over a gas resource tax.\nBHP Petroleum's pre-abormal result also included a A$82 million windfall from asset sales and a larger than expected exploration expense.\nBHP's minerals division, a major world producer of iron ore and coal, doubled its contribution to profit in the second quarter to A$154 million, due largely to higher world prices.\nBHP Copper benefitted from a recent firming in the copper price and a cut of seven U.S. cents per pound in its North American operating costs to post a second quarter profit of A$132 million, up from A$85 million in the first quarter.\nThe U.S. copper operations, acquired last January with the US$2.4 billion purchase of Magma Copper, made a loss on a full-cost basis in the first quarter. Prescott said on Friday Magma had swung back into profit in the second quarter.\nBHP Steel's second-quarter profit was flat at A$90 million.",

The shares fell eight cents on the news, but rebounded to end at A$6.88, up six cents from Friday's close.\nComalco is owned 67 percent by global mining group RTZ-CRA, due to report its annual profit on Thursday.\n\"The market has pretty much factored in the loss and is now focusing on future earnings prospects,\" one share trader said.\nAs expected, Comalco's smelting division played a part in the earnings nose-dive. It made a loss for the year, but this paled in comparison with the damage done to Comalco's earnings by the slump in aluminium prices and a strong local currency.\n\"The 1996 result was severely impacted by lower prices,\" chief executive Terry Palmer told reporters in Melbourne.\nThe London Metal Exchange (LME) aluminium price averaged 70 U.S. cents a pound in 1996, compared with an average of 83 cents in 1995, the company said. The Australian dollar averaged 78 U.S. cents in 1996, four cents stronger than in 1995, it added.\nComalco's premiums over the LME price also suffered. Together, the aluminium market and the local dollar pared a total of about A$201 from operating profit, overwhelming a rise in total production volumes, the company said.\nBut Palmer painted a much brighter outlook, assuring investors that Comalco's aluminium production is set to climb and predicting a stronger aluminium price over 1997.\nComalco saw firming global demand for the metal this year, fuelled by economic recovery in Europe and continued growth in the United States. \"Consumption in Asia is not expected to grow in 1997,\" the company said.\nComalco also denied market speculation it might sell off its smelters and abandon its plan to build a A$1 billion alumina refinery in either Queensland state or Sarawak, Malaysia. Alumina, produced from bauxite, is the raw material for making aluminium.\n\"The current talk about that (withdrawing from smelting) is one hell of a way wide of the mark,\" Palmer said.\n\"The position with the alumina project remains unchanged,\" he added.\nComalco hopes to start building the refinery, with annual capacity of one million to 1.5 million tonnes, in 1998. Site selection will depend heavily on the kind of power contracts Queensland and Malaysia can offer, Palmer said.",

        "Text": "The world's biggest mining house, RTZ Corp Plc-CRA Ltd, is set to report a sharp fall in annual profit this week after shouldering a slide in metal prices during the year and battling problems with its U.S. copper smelter, mining analysts said.\nThe group, which has operations spanning the globe, is on average expected to post a 26-percent fall in net profit before exceptional items to US$1.067 billion for calendar 1996, a Reuter survey of six Australian brokerages revealed.\nRTZ-CRA, a dual-listed merger of British-based RTZ Plc and Australian-based CRA Ltd, is due to announce its earnings on Thursday. It made US$1.441 billion in 1995.\nAustralian analysts' forecasts range between US$1.04 billion and US$1.097 billion, although private forecasting service Barceps quoted much lower numbers in a survey last month.\nThe culprits behind RTZ-CRA's profit slump are seen as the copper price, which dipped below 90 U.S. cents a pound after the Sumitomo trading scandal erupted in June, a weak aluminium price and problems with the flagship Bingham Canyon copper smelter.\nTogether, copper and aluminium earned almost 41 percent of RTZ-CRA's total revenue in 1995, and metal prices were promising enough early in 1996 for the group to talk of higher earnings.\nBut metal prices caught a cold and the prospects of improved profits also began to look sick mid-year, when the Sumitomo Corp trading scandal sent international copper prices crashing.\nYasuo Hamanaka, a star trader who once dominated the copper market, has admitted charges of fraud and forgery and accepted blame for a scandal that cost Sumitomo $2.6 billion and devalued the copper inventories of metals companies around the world.\n\"Everything peaked ahead of this Hamanaka copper thing,\" said Peter O'Connor of Macquarie Bank.\n\"Most commodities slid from June on through to about September, October and there's been a bit of recovery in most metal prices since that time.\"\nRTZ-CRA's iron ore business was also a disappointment, one analyst said, noting that sales for the year dropped six percent despite a lift in annual output.\nAdding salt to the wound, the gold price also languished. Gold is a sensitive area for the mining giant, since it is fundamentally opposed to selling its production forward at a fixed price to lock in revenue.\nRTZ-CRA's coal mines are also not expected to have relieved some of the pain inflicted on the group by weak prices. One analyst expects coal earnings to fall 10 percent in 1996.\nRTZ-CRA's troubled Bingham Canyon smelter in Utah has stirred the deepest concerns among analysts, who have been waiting for the new plant to get it right after 18 months of hobbled operation. The smelter is still not operating at full capacity and soon faces a six-week shut-down soon for major modifications.\nCopper division earnings are forecast to plunge by some 40 percent, according to HSBC James Capel's forecast.\nStill, the brokerage likes the group's long-term prospects, which include a copper mine in Chile and a copper and gold mine in Indonesia.\n\"They have a very, very strong organic growth profile,\" said HSBC James Capel analyst Umit Safak. \"They have very substantial expansions coming up,\" he added.",

December and January are usually the firm's peak months.  \nHarvey Norman is still hoping for a heatwave, but hot weather has its biggest impact on sales before Christmas when a lot of discretionary household expenditure is spent, he added.\nThe company is also pinning its hopes on a turnaround in consumer spending in the first half of calendar 1997 to enable Harvey Norman to reach its 15 percent sales target, but Harvey said there appeared to be little joy on the immediate horizon.\n\"Through last year we were basically saying it's got to turn in the second quarter of '97 calendar year, but at moment there's nothing to indicate that's going to happen...,\" he said.  \n\"My view is that next financial year starting July it will be a better year than this year and last year, but in terms of when it will actually start to turn, we are hoping...it will be the second quarter,\" Harvey said.\n\"I don't think we are going to see much joy in January, February, but it's our hope that things will turn come March, April, May, June,\" he said.",

Foster's China posted a 1995/96 loss of A$17 million (US$13 million) before interest and tax.\nThe group's 40-percent owned Canadian brewer, Molson Breweries, also performed weakly in its business year ending April 1, but has undergone a major restructure and is focusing on building market share at home, Foster's said.\nFoster's chief executive Kunkel said Molson still delivered a high return on invested capital and forecast higher operating profits from the group's powerhouse Australian brewing unit, Carlton and United Breweries, over the medium term.\nFoster's also plans to free up about A$400 million in non-performing assets and is counting on higher returns from its British pub chain, the Inntrepreneur Pub Company Ltd, putting the group in a stong position to pursue growth, Kunkel said.\nKunkel identified Asia as the most attractive region for investment, noting beer volumes there surged 60 percent in the first half of the 1990s and were forecast to rise another 40 percent before the turn of the century.\n\"Access can be achieved at a sufficiently low cost and the return profile is sufficiently better therefore than in other growing markets such as South America,\" he said.\nFoster's has allocated A$200 million for direct investments in Asian markets, deeming this amount a \"prudent exposure\".\nThe group has spent four years shedding unwanted assets, lightening the burden of debt accumulated in the 1980s when it was part of the sprawling conglomerate known as Elders-IXL Ltd.\nFoster's sold its British brewing unit, Courage, last year as part of this asset-sale programme. It has since bought two Australian wine-makers, Mildara Blass and Rothbury Wines Ltd.\n\"The restructuring of the last four years is nearly over,\" he said. \"Where there is more, it will present opportunities for profit.\"\nFoster's is on track to better its 1995/96 net profit of A$293.3 million in 1996/97, despite higher interest charges and tax payments in the current year, chairman Ralph said.",

        "Text": "Boeing Co's planned $13 billion acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp. will propel it to a leading position as a military contractor, matching its stature as the world leader in commercial aviation.\nWhile Europe's Airbus Industrie is likely to feel competitive pressure because of Boeing's increased resources, industry analysts said the chief benefits for Boeing would be on the military side.\n\"Historically Boeing's military business was something of an also-ran,\" said Cai von Rumohr, an analyst at Cowen & Co. \"With this transaction in one fell swoop they become a very major player.\"\nOne analyst said the combined company could get nearly 50 percent of its revenues from government contracts, up from Boeing's historical 25 to 30 percent.\nThe deal follows by little more than a week the completion of Boeing's $3.2 billion acquisition of Rockwell International Corp's defence and space business.\nAnd it comes just a month after McDonnell Douglas was eliminated from consideration to build the military's 21st century joint strike fighter plane.\nInstead the Pentagon chose Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp -- the nation's largest military contractor -- to build prototype versions of the new fighter jet in a contract that could be worth $200 billion or more to the eventual winner.\nThe addition of McDonnell Douglas' expertise makes Boeing \"the team to beat\" on the crucial programme, said Paul Nisbet of JSA Securities.\nAnalyst Nick Heymann of Natwest Securities said the loss of the joint strike fighter was the crowning blow for McDonnell Douglas, which already had announced its intention to back away from the commercial aviation market, where it has been only a marginal player in recent years.\n\"McDonnell Douglas just didn't have the resources to aggressively fund its development programmes,\" he said. \"They got stretched too thin on transports and fighters and commercial, and they underinvested.\"\nNevertheless the friendly all-stock deal does not necessarily mean that McDonnell Douglas executives failed in their effort to turn around the company, analysts said.\nFor one thing the offer price of about $62.89 a share based on Friday's close is well beyond the stock's all-time high and about 10 times its level of the early 1990s, said Wolfgang Demisch of BT Securities.\nIn addition the merger is being done at the very beginning of an expansion cycle in the industry, meaning layoffs can be minimised and the companies have several years to rationalise their operations before the next expected downturn.\n\"It isn't a case that you're merging because you're starving to death,\" said Demisch. \"It's a case that there's lots of opportunity. ... That's a much healthier basis on which to consolidate.\"\nIndeed Boeing chief executive Phil Condit said the combined companies would have revenues of $48 billion next year, up more than 30 percent from a projected $35 billion this year.\n\"We are going to be going after $1 billion or more of savings a year, but we are going to be doing in it in an environment where the overall growth is occurring,\" Condit said at a news conference. \"That's the advantage we have got right now.\"\nCondit, who will become chairman and chief executive officer of the combined company, said final merger negotiations began Tuesday, the day after he was elected to become Boeing's chairman effective Feb. 1.\nWhile Boeing does not currently need additional capacity to produce commercial jets, it will benefit from additional engineering strength, which will allow it to produce new models or variations of existing jets more quickly.\nAnalysts predicted the deal would win clearance from federal antitrust regulators, noting that no protests were raised this month when the two companies struck a deal to work together on engineering new wide-body jets.\nAnd analysts said they thought the deal would win approval from the Pentagon, which has encouraged industry consolidation and backed the deal that created No. 1 defence contractor Lockheed Martin in 1994.\nPerhaps the chief concern for federal regulators will be Boeing's overwhelming size, which will be nearly twice that of its nearest rival Lockeheed Martin if the deal goes through.",

The board of the pilots union was voting Wednesday on a tentative labor pact reached in September.\nIndustry analysts saw the order as a signal American could order hundreds of Boeing jets over the next two decades as it updates and expands its fleet, now a mix of planes built by Boeing, McDonnell Douglas Corp., Airbus Industrie and Fokker NV.\n\"I think basically this is a commitment to the Boeing family,\" analyst Bill Whitlow of Pacific Crest Securities said.\n\"If you look at their fleet, they (American) have kind of a hodgepodge of things,\" he said. \"I think you can make the case that most of the airplanes they will be buying in the future will be these Boeing models.\"\nAmerican currently does not operate the 737, which seats from 108 to 189 passengers and initially will be used to replace the 75 older 727 jets used by the airline.\nBut analysts said that over the next decade American likely will buy more 737s to replace its fleet of 260 aging McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets.\nAmerican already has announced plans to sell most of its wide-body MD-11 jets to Federal Express Corp. for use as cargo jets, and analysts said Boeing's 777 would be a likely replacement choice suitable for the carrier's potential expansion in the Far East.\nAnalyst Paul Nisbet of JSA Research said American, the nation's No. 1 airline by revenue, appears to be turning over \"the whole fleet to Boeing aircraft.\"\n\"It's a huge fleet,\" he said. \"Over the next decade there's going to be a lot more than $6 billion in planes delivered.\"\nFor beleaguered McDonnell Douglas Corp., the decision would be yet another blow for a company that has acknowledged it will be only a niche player in the commercial aircraft market and last week was knocked out of contention for the Pentagon's biggest weapons program of the early 21st century, a jet fighter.\nAnalysts said they still expect a big fleet-renewal order from No. 3 carrier Delta Air Lines Inc., which could go at least partly to McDonnell Douglas.\n\"Somewhere along the line this is going to bubble over in McDonell Douglas' favor,\" Nisbet said.\nOther major U.S. carriers already have announced their intentions to buy new airplanes now that the industry has returned to financial health after a long downturn.\nEarlier this month, USAir Group Inc. chose Europe's Airbus Industrie to supply it with narrow-body jets in an order that could be worth $18 billion over the next 13 years. The carrier is negotiating with Boeing and Airbus for new wide-body jets.\nBoeing stock rose $2.375 to $96.375 Wednesday and AMR stock was off 62.5 cents at $91, both on the New York Stock Exchange.",

        "Text": "Boeing Co.'s stunning agreement to acquire longtime rival McDonnell Douglas Corp. won a ringing endorsement from Wall Street and sent shock waves through the aerospace industry Monday.\nStock in both companies soared on expectations the deal would boost Boeing's operating profits immediately after its completion, targeted for mid-1997.\nBoeing rose $4.375 to $101.125 and McDonnell Douglas jumped $10.375 to $62.375, down from earlier highs on the New York Stock Exchange but good enough to give the all-stock transaction an indicated value of nearly $14 billion.\nIndustry analysts saw few obstacles to the deal, which marks a startling transformation for a company that just a year ago was completing a final round of cutbacks that had slashed its work force by 30 percent in five years.\nSince then Boeing has completed the $3.2 billion acquisition of Rockwell International Corp.'s defense and space business, won the right to compete for the richest military contract in Pentagon history and announced orders for a record $45.6 billion in new commercial jets.\n\"It's an incredible turnaround story,\" said Jon Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners, which specializes in aerospace. \"These are very bold, dramatic, uncharacteristic moves for Boeing and I applaud them for it.\"\nWhile Boeing had been moving to cut costs and transform its management style under outgoing Chairman Frank Shrontz, the pace has accelerated at the once-sluggish company since Phil Condit was named chief executive officer in April.\nCondit began the final round of merger negotiations with McDonnell Douglas last Tuesday, just a day after being formally elected Boeing chairman as of Feb. 1, 1997.\n\"We're seeing Boeing evolve from kind of a stodgy company to being very aggressive, nimble,\" said Bill Whitlow, a longtime Boeing analyst at Pacific Crest Securities who praised Condit's energy and stamina.\nExecutives at the two companies said the deal would be additive to operating profits immediately and reiterated their prediction that Boeing could achieve $1 billion in annual savings without any layoffs because of rapid growth.\nAnalysts said the merger was a good strategy for McDonnell Douglas, which already had announced plans to pull back from commercial aviation when it was eliminated from bidding for the Pentagon's 21st century joint strike fighter.\nBut Harry Stonecipher, chief executive of McDonnell Douglas, denied that the merger was born of desperation.\n\"This is the deal we wanted and we are very happy with it,\" Stonecipher told CNBC. \"This is the only deal we considered.\"\nBoeing executives told analysts they had no immediate plans to make further acquisitions, even though the combined company will generate cash flow of more than $4 billion a year on projected 1997 revenue of $48 billion.\nThe surprise merger immediately turned up the heat on Europe's Airbus Industrie to move ahead quickly with a restructuring plan. Without such a plan, the consortium would be unable to go ahead with a proposed super-jumbo aircraft to compete with Boeing's 747, which now is unchallenged at the profitable top end of the market, analysts said.\n\"Airbus Industrie and its partners must agree as soon as possible on an optimal structure that will allow Airbus Industrie to match its American competitors as a powerful, integrated European enterprise,\" German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said in a statement.\nAnalysts noted that Boeing had ended any chance that Airbus would partner with McDonnell on a new large jet, and some said Boeing's own plans to stretch the 747 might now be deferred.\nBut both Airbus and Boeing could benefit from stabilized airplane prices with the No. 3 player out of the market.\nDespite some overlapping businesses, including helicopters, rockets and missiles, experts saw little possibility the deal would be stopped by the Defense Department, although the combination of the nation's only manufacturers of commercial jets could give pause to federal antitrust regulators.\n\"It will be interesting to see what the airlines have to say about this,\" said Don Baker, a former antitrust official now with the firm Baker and Miller in Washington.\n\"It's worth remembering that there would be just two players in the worldwide market for big planes,\" he said. \"But maybe two is enough competition for the airlines.\"\nOn the defense side, analysts said they expected the marriage of Boeing and McDonnell to spur further consolidation, with players such as Raytheon Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp. looking for partners.\nCowen & Co. analyst Cai von Rumohr said the deal gives Raytheon, which supplies missile systems, \"a window of opportunity\" to buy Hughes Electronics Corp..\n\"It's not a long-term window,\" he said. \"It will probably last until the (Boeing-McDonnell) deal is closed.\"",

Bondholders will get from 93 to 95 percent of the $365 million they were owed, one banker said.\nExecutives say the new company will be profitable from the outset, with revenues estimated at $1.59 billion and net income at $31 million for its first full fiscal year beginning Dec. 1, according to bankruptcy court documents.\nThat compares with revenue of $2.72 billion and net income of $36 million in 1993, before the company reported losses that totalled more than $600 million over two years.\nAnalysts traced Morrison Knudsen's woes to a disastrous forway into railroads, including huge losses on bids to build new commuter transit cars, a business the company has exited.\nAgee's ambitious plan to build new locomotives from the ground up never materialised, and its minority stake in MK Rail Corp. is being distributed to bondholders.\nAgee himself, who once used a corporate jet to shuttle between Boise and his company-bought estate in Pebble Beach, Calif., was forced to give up some of his lucrative pension and severance benefits in a $63 million company settlement of class-action shareholder lawsuits.\nThe new Morrison will get about 90 percent of its revenues from three businesses -- industrial construction for Fortune 100 companies, heavy civil construction, and environmental remediation, mainly for government agencies, Tinstman said in an interview.\n\"Dennis very much wants this to be a well-balanced, diversified company,\" Tinstman said.\nThe remaining 10 percent of the company's business is mining.\nWashington, who usually stays behind the scenes at his companies, will help set strategy at the new Morrison Knudsen but will not have a day-to-day role, Tinstman said.\nMorrison Knudsen Chairman Robert Miller, who was brought in last year and is best known for helping to engineer Chrysler Corp.'s turnaround in the 1980s, will be vice chairman of the new company. The other vice chairman will be Washington aide Dorn Parkinson.",

In last year's fiscal first quarter Microsoft reported net income of $499 million.\nAnalysts generally said the Redmond, Wash.-based company would post revenues in the $2.3 billion range for the period that ended Sept. 30, up from $2.02 billion.\nWhile Microsoft's growth rate is still healthy, and results are expected to be slightly higher than in the quarter ended in June, the company is facing difficult comparisons after last year, when revenues and earnings grew more than 46 percent.\n\"It's a tough comparison because in the September quarter last year was the initial release of Windows 95 and all the sell-in associated with that, so it was a great quarter,\" said Chris Galvin of Hambrecht and Quist.\nBut he and other analysts said Microsoft's business was continuing to expand steadily, benefiting from rising sales of personal computers and the increasing penetration of Windows 95 and the more lucrative Windows NT system.\nMicrosoft's already-high profit margins also are rising as the company sells a growing proportion of its software by preloading it onto new computers or selling licenses to large customers rather than shrink-wrapped boxes at retail stores.\nMicrosoft's business is expected to gain momentum through the fiscal year as the recently updated Windows NT wins more acceptance and the company rolls out a major new version of its Office software package beginning in December.\nFor the full fiscal year, analysts see earnings and sales up about 20 percent over last year.\n\"I think NT will really start ramping in the December quarter and in the first part of '97,\" said Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie. \"It's going to be a very powerful driver of earnings.\"\nOne cloud on Microsoft's horizon is the imminent arrival of a wave of \"thin client\" products such as the Network Computer championed by Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison.\nLate this month, Sun Microsystems Inc. is expected to launch a line of products code-named \"Mr. Coffee\" based on the increasingly popular Java language, which is being positioned as an alternative to the \"Wintel\" combination of Microsoft Windows operating systems on Intel Corp. processors.\nWhile corporate users are not rushing to desert their personal computer networks, the increasing publicity about alternatives could hurt Microsoft's stock price, which was off $1.25 Friday at $134.25 in afteroon trading on Nasdaq but still up more than 50 percent so far this year.",

        "Text": "Boeing Co, the world leader in commercial aviation, flew into the ranks of the top military contractors as well on Sunday when it announced its planned $13 billion acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp.\nBoeing's increased resources should put competitive pressure on its commercial rival, Europe's Airbus Industrie. But industry analysts said the chief benefits for Boeing would be on the military side.  \n\"Historically Boeing's military business was something of an also-ran,\" said Cai von Rumohr, an analyst at Cowen & Co. \"With this transaction in one fell swoop they become a very major player.\"\nOne analyst said the combined company could get nearly 50 percent of its revenues from government contracts, up from Boeing's historical 25 to 30 percent.  \nThe deal follows by little more than a week the completion of Boeing's $3.2 billion acquisition of Rockwell International Corp's defense and space business and comes just a month after McDonnell Douglas was was eliminated from consideration to build the military's 21st century joint strike fighter plane.\nInstead, the Pentagon chose Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp -- the nation's largest military contractor -- to build prototype versions of the new fighter jet in a contract that could be worth $200 billion or more to the eventual winner.  \nThe addition of McDonnell Douglas' expertise makes Boeing \"the team to beat\" on that crucial program, said Paul Nisbet of JSA Securities.\nLoss of the joint strike fighter was the final blow for McDonnell Douglas, said analyst Nick Heymann of Natwest Securities. McDonnell had already announced its intention to back away from the commercial aviation market, where it has been only a marginal player in recent years.  \n\"McDonnell Douglas just didn't have the resources to aggressively fund its development programs,\" he said. \"They got stretched too thin on transports and fighters and commercial, and they underinvested.\"\nNevertheless the friendly all-stock deal does not necessarily mean that McDonnell Douglas executives failed in their effort to turn around the company, analysts said.\nFor one thing, the offer price of about $62.89 a share based on Friday's close is well beyond McDonnell's all-time high and about 10 times its level of the early 1990s, said Wolfgang Demisch of BT Securities.  \nIn addition, the merger is being done at the very beginning of an expansion cycle in the industry, meaning layoffs can be minimized and the companies have several years to rationalize their operations before the next expected downturn.\n\"It isn't a case that you're merging because you're starving to death,\" said Demisch. \"It's a case that there's lots of opportunity. ... That's a much healthier basis on which to consolidate.\"  \nIndeed, Boeing Chief Executive Phil Condit said the combined companies would have revenues of $48 billion next year, up more than 30 percent from a projected $35 billion this year.\n\"We are going to be going after $1 billion or more of savings a year, but we are going to be doing in it in an environment where the overall growth is occurring,\" Condit said at a news conference. \"That's the advantage we have got right now.\"  \nCompany officials said any job losses would likely be minimal. There may be overlaps in some areas, Condit said, but he added: \"I don't think those are going to be significant numbers.\"\nExecutives said the merger would cause \"reassignments,\" and operations were expected to continue at existing major locations, including St Louis, where McDonnell Douglas is based.\nMurray Weidenbaum, chairman of the Centre for the Study of American Business at Washington University and former chief economist for Boeing, said the deal could have benefits for St. Louis.  \nBoeing has a better chance of landing the $200 billion U.S. fighter-jet contract, which is still up for grabs, with McDonnell Douglas on board, he speculated. That could mean more work for St. Louis.\n\"It's an opportunity and a threat to the St. Louis economy,\" he said.\nCondit, who will become chairman and chief executive officer of the combined company, said final merger negotiations began Tuesday, the day after he was elected to become Boeing's chairman effective Feb. 1.\nWhile Boeing does not currently need additional capacity to produce commercial jets, it will benefit from additional engineering strength, which will allow it to produce new models or variations of existing jets more quickly.\nThe merger will leave Airbus Industrie as the only other major player in the business of making large commercial aircraft. An Airbus spokesman said McDonnell Douglas has not been a competitor in the civilian aircraft business for a number of years \"so it hasn't altered the equation in the commercial field at all for Airbus.\"\nAnalysts predicted the deal would win clearance from federal antitrust regulators, noting that no protests were raised this month when the two companies struck a deal to work together on engineering new wide-body jets.\nThey thought the deal would win approval from the Pentagon, which has encouraged industry consolidation and backed the deal that created No. 1 defense contractor Lockheed Martin in 1994.\nPerhaps the chief concern for federal regulators will be Boeing's overwhelming size, which will be nearly twice that of its nearest rival Lockeheed Martin.\nMajor U.S. airlines said it was too soon to forecast the impact of the proposed merger on airliner prices or their airplane-buying strategies. \"It is too early to tell,\" Delta Air Lines Inc spokesman Todd Clay said.",

Louisiana-Pacific agreed last year to pay up to $375 million to settle claims by homeowners in Florida, Oregon and Washington, among other states.\nSuwyn said the shareholder lawsuits were the last major cloud over a company the he joined this year after the ouster of its longtime Chairman and Chief Executive Harry Merlo.\n\"We're simply trying to clean up all the things that are not going to contribute to moving this company forward,\" he said.",

We have a mixture of harmattan (hot, dry) conditions in some places but light rains nearby,\" said one crop analyst. \"Pod setting and progression could be affected. It just depends on rains before December as the front passes,\" he added.\nWeather analysts said the front that usually heads southwards in September, giving Ivory coast a light rainy season between September and December, had finally moved south over the weekend. But rains were still far below average.\n\"It is now over Dimbokro (seventh northern parallel) but rains are well over a month late. So far we have not had a small rainy season,\" said one weather analyst.\nWeather data showed less than 50 percent of average October rains fell in Ivory Coast. Data for early November were not available to build a clear picture of the overall rainfall pattern in early November, said analysts.\n\"Flowering and soil moisture vary greatly between regions but cherelle (early pod) setting should be clearer later in November,\" said a crop analyst who recently toured Ivorian farms.\nUp-country buyers around Daloa told Reuters intermittent rains had started in the centre-west cocoa region but more rain was needed for late main and early mid-crop development.\nIvory Coast opened its 1996/97 cocoa marketing season late on October 24 after rain deluges in July and August. Bean moisture was no longer a problem, they said.\n\"Now there is a nice mixture of rain and sun but we need more rain up to the end of the year to avoid small mid-crop bean sizes,\" said one buyer. Beans sizes of over 110 per 100 grammes are not considered to be of export quality.\nCrop analysts said soil moisture levels were low in some areas and could affect pod sizes if sunny weather continued. One crop analyst told Reuters he had only seen rain on two out of his 10 days of treking around the whole cocoa belt.\nOfficial weather data showed average or above rains in Man and Gagnoa, but rain deficits elsewhere, particularly south of Gagnoa, around Sassandra, Abidjan and Adiake.\nSunny conditions had prevailed in the south as monsoon air was at higher altitudes south of Gagnoa than usual, said the weather analyst.\n\"The sun is burning off low clouds,\" he said.\nElsewhere, one crop analyst said the danger in Ghana of blackpod, a fungus hitting cocoa pods in prolonged cool and damp spells, had gone after regional attacks in September. Rains there had been heavier than in Ivory Coast.",

Others agreed and said Abidjan and San Pedro port stocks had risen over the past week.\nOfficial statistics for October and November are not yet available but about 100,000 tonnes had been exported by the same date in 1995/96. Shipments then had been delayed in a shipping freight rate dispute, making year-on comparisons difficult.\nUnder 10,000 tonnes were exported in October 1996 and volumes for this year are expected to be small as the marketing season opened over two weeks later than usual on October 24.\nExporters said arrivals in 1996/97 had reached 285,000 tonnes by end-November. Some put the figure at closer to 300,000.\n\"That would leave stocks of around 150,000 tonnes, which sounds a bit high,\" said one. But large shipments in early December would have already cut into that volume, he added.\nShippers looking ahead expected arrivals to slacken from mid-December to end-January before a steady flow until the end of March.\n\"There's also plenty of coffee to deal with this year. Cocoa should take off again in February and March,\" said one exporter. \"There's not much demand and plenty of stocks in Europe.\"\nCocoa crop analysts said an extension of light rains well into December would greatly improve mid-crop prospects. Drying could slow arrivals but only marginally. Shipments would rise again from February.\n\"The trees are flushing now and large pods have been taken off. That gives trees more reserves for flowering,\" said one.\nPeak 1996/97 harvesting is expected in late December and early January, boosting early February arrivals for shipments to meet benchmark March contracts.\nHarvested cocoa usually takes about 21-27 days to reach ports for shipment, after fermenting, drying, sorting, bagging and transport.\n\"The year will certainly be drawn out until March,\" he said.\nMid-crop volumes from March onwards still unpredictable but will be favoured by continuing light rains.\nSome shipping freight rate elements were still under discussion this week but those set on October 24 in the 1996/87 Caistab marketing agency price list were largely accepted. No delays to shipments were expected, said exporters.\nSome exporters said they had negotiated cheaper rates for some destinations than last year, especially for U.S.-bound cargo, as premiums on space had dropped with arrivals volumes down.",

Sunshine after August had helped the outlook for March while lighter rains, which started in early November, would boost flowering for mid-crop pods.\nWidespread wilting of smaller pods was noted this week on on southwestern farms east and north of San Pedro last visited in September. Insect damage and \"black pod\" fungus had also been noticeable.\nThe Ivory Coast has slated 950,000 tonnes for its total 1996/97 output after private forecaster estimates of 850-900,000 for the main crop alone. The 1995/96 season hit a 1.2 million tonnes record after a higher than expected mid-crop of 200,000 tonnes.\nBut one San Pedro exporter said, \"There will be no more than 900,000 tonnes for the whole year. It could have been better but pod deterioration, insects and maybe even the trees' natural cycle have had an effect.\"\nLocal buyers and other exporters in the southwest agree, some putting the output at even less, but they say mid-crop predictions are unreliable.\nFew flowers and pods were seen on coastal farms and little cocoa was drying along roadsides. Tree pods and village stores were more plentiful in productive Meadji and Soubre areas.\nExporters and buyers in the southwest now matching cocoa arrivals data with last season's say volumes are down, with humidity higher at 8-10 percent and smaller bean sizes of between 93 and 100 per 100 grammes, against 85-90 last year.\n\"There is less cocoa than last year. It takes twice as long to fill a truck driving around the bush and it needs a lot of drying,\" said a buyer in Sassandra. Buyers elsewhere agreed.\nCumulative arrivals to end-November could be 250,000 tonnes, the sources said. One put registered cumulative arrivals at 213,000 to November 24, with 85,000 arriving in the week up to then. November arrivals last year topped 300,000.\nBuyers and exporters foresee arrivals of around 250,000- 300,000 for December against about 400,000 in 1995/96.\nA San Pedro exporters' agent said he had taken in 22,800 tonnes of cocoa this season with 10,000 still in stores and room for 25,000 more. Many San Pedro warehouses were full this time last year.\nAnother said their cumulative year-on arrivals were down 15 percent at November 24 and expected the gap to widen in December.\nSan Pedro's largest port handler expects up to 30 percent less volume this year and said arrivals to November 17 totalled 70,000 tonnes. The port expects to handle a third of this year's crop.\nCocoa quality is good but some mouldy, moist and deteriorated beans were being mixed in the rush to supply exporters.\n\"Some buyers can charge higher prices as export contracts have been sold up to March and have to be met,\" said one. Mould levels were around four percent, he added.\nSome buyers have supplied farmers with insecticides and say dry Harmattan weather moving southwards will help drying. One 15-tonne capacity dryer was out of action after a fire at a San Pedro plant on Saturday.\nExporters said they now accept the 1996/97 list of marketing prices set by the government this month after a late start to the season. But they said the Caistab marketing board had not altered its auctioning system to prevent overbidding.\nSmaller exporters say some people have been laid off until March as they cannot match prices bid over opening calls.\n\"About 750,000 tonnes have been sold to highest bidders but the Caistab has not sold the 15 percent it retains. Maybe they are waiting for higher world prices,\" one exporter said.\nA San Pedro factory said it aimed to process 25-30,000 tonnes of cocoa this year.",

The world's largest producer blazed the trail by shipping 120,000 tonnes in 1995/96 as bagged cocoa lost favour with large buyers, said the source.\nOf this year's total, about 260,000 tonnes would be shipped for two Amsterdam-based clients out of an expected crop of 900,000 to one million tonnes, said the trader.\nLess than half, about 120,000 tonnes, would be shipped loose on holds against the same tonnage for all forms of bulk shipments in 1995/96. The remainder would be leave in twenty-foot bag-lined containers packed with drying agents.\nAdditional shipments of about 5,000 tonnes for trials to Germany, and less for Mediterranean ports would take the total of both bulk methods to around 270,000 tonnes.\nGhana is also expected to build on small shipments with 25,000 tonnes possibly leaving in December. Volumes from Nigeria and Cameroun are widely expected to rise.\nLittle was shipped in bulk from other West African ports last year but shipping companies say that will change.\nDutch transporters Spliethoffe completed three successful trials from Ivory Coast in 1995/96 totalling about 10,000 tonnes followed by another 110,000 tonnes for processors Gerkens and Cacao De Zaan.\nThe loading and shipment methods developed then has prompted an expected 100 percent plus jump in overall regional tonnages for 1996/97, say shippers.\nShipping lines Nedlloyd, Compagnie Maritime Belge (CMB) and Delmas (SDV) are already taking bulk cargos from forwarders SAGA and Delmas, and Ivorian exporters/forwarders Jean-Abile Gal and SIFCA.\n\"Each have loading systems (total of 8) in Abidjan and San Pedro (Ivory Coast's second port) but only direct users have reception facilities,\" a West Africa region shipping manager said. \"Not everyone has a 4,000 tonnes a day capacity plant with storage facilities,\" he added, referring to large processors in Amsterdam.\n\"In future, about  25 percent of all cocoa will leave in bulk,\" said one shipping manager, depending on the size of the reference crop\nThe manager of another shipper handling large volumes put the figure at 40 percent by 2000 for Ivory Coast.\n\"The economics are simple. What used to be shipped in four containers is now shipped in three,\" he said, or 100 tonees per six 20 foot containers.\nShipping companies had gained a 25 percent freight space saving and exporters would expect rebates in return, he said.\nA typical charter on FIOS (free in and out, stowed) rates would be 55 dollars, with another 25 dollars in handling to be added depending on terms, said one shipping line.\nThe marginal cost of loading a container was about 3,750 CFA a tonne with 55,000 CFA for positioning a container, but labour and time savings more than compensated. Conveyor belts, silos and tip-up containers are all used for loading.\nPlans to build a new bulk reception warehouse in Amsterdam unveiled by Dutch Cocoa Association (NCV) president Louis Bensdorp on Friday would encourage bulk cocoa advocates, said local exporters.",

In 1994/95 the amounts were shown as 43,000 and 9,000 tonnes.\nSOGEPAG was set up in 1991 and guaranteed farmers fixed farmgate prices when world prices dipped. It paid official reference prices while other buyers paid less, said Blind.\n\"Our operation was based on protection against prices going down, but prices went up after 1991,\" he said. \"The aim was to take 20 percent of the market in three years but our sales only rose by about seven percent a year.\"\nThe total Ivorian cocoa crop in 1995/96 was about 1.2 million tonnes.\nUp-country buyers said SOGEPAG had not understood buying strategy upcountry. It paid cash but sometimes three days late.\n\"Our strategy was wrong. Farmers preferred immediate cash in hand, even if less than our prices,\" said Blind. \"We gave prefinancing and logistical support to farmers on good terms and then they would sell to someone else.\"\nSOGEPAG built up the number of its sites to 17 from four at its inception.\nOther exporters said SOGEPAG's closure would have no effect on the market. \"SIFCA and DAFCI will probably take control of the key assets and others will step in to buy whatever is sold,\" said one.\n\"We will buy some of their trucks,\" said one buyer. \"No cocoa will be left in the bush.\"\nSOGEPAG has 120 vehicles, mainly collection trucks and tractors it used to hire to farmers and GVCs -- farmers' cooperatives which aim to sell directly to exporters.\nSIFCA's parent SIFCOM is a main distributor of Nissan vehicles.\nBlind said SOGEPAG was owed 160 million CFA francs for vehicle hire at one point but only 60 million had been repaid. \"Farmers saw us as a cash cow,\" he said. \"Variable cost inflation after depreciation of the CFA also got out of hand.\"\nHe said many modern trucks on the market were too sophisticated and expensive for farmers.\nSome industry analysts said farmers had made money out of SOGEPAG but did not see why a decision had been taken to close operations at this point.\n\"It is a pity for the farmers.  The World Bank had just approved funding for us to give them more training,\" said Blind. \"Now they will be paid less than reference prices and many GVCs have poor little logistical expertise.\"\nIvory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, opened its 1996/97 cocoa marketing season on October 24, setting farmgate cocoa prices unchanged at 320 CFA per bagged kg but delaying an announcement on guideline buyers and exporters rates.\n($1=512 CFA francs)",

No preparations have yet been made at political and management levels and there has been no public debate,\" he said.\nAfter decades of civil strife or conflict with neighbouring Libya, Chad held its first multiparty legislative elections on January 5, marking a symbolic transition to peace.\nOther political party leaders, who like Kebzabo, contested the elections, voiced similar concerns.\n\"We must have laws to ensure all interests are served, with Chad at the centre,\" said Lol Mahamet Choua, who draws support near the smaller Sedigi oilfield on the shores of Lake Chad.\nExxon's unit Esso Exploration and Production Chad Inc., a 40 percent-share consortium member with Shell's Chad unit (40 percent) and Elf (20 percent) in November sealed a deal with Chad on finance and legal terms for Chad's main field 350 miles (560 km) south of N'Djamena.\nDoba, due on stream in 2001, is forecast to yield 900 million barrels, or 200,000-250,000 bpd over 15-20 years, at a cost of $3 billion, according to Exxon, Houston.

        "Text": "Eastman Kodak Co secured only a partial exit from the bruising copier wars with the $684 million sale on Monday of its copier-marketing and service operations to Britain's Danka Business Systems Plc.\nPrompted by chronic financial weakness, highlighted by the fact Kodak's copier sales of $1.8 billion yield only $20 million in annual operating profits, the sale prompted segment leader Xerox Corp to throw down the gauntlet to Danka.\n\"They're on our turf now and are going to have to chase us to win business,\" said Xerox executive Gill Hatch.  \nHatch predicted the Danka-Kodak deal will bring pricing pressures to the copier business. \"Suffice to say that Danka has been aggressive, and will continue to be aggressive,\" Hatch said.\nAccording to Danka chief executive Dan Doyle, the acquisition and a 10-year alliance with Kodak will give high-flying Danka a full line of copiers to offer low, middle and upmarket customers around the world.\nKodak is retaining its manufacturing and development operations in copiers, as well as some key technology.  \nThe remaining Kodak businesses will have about $600 million a year in sales, or a third of its former turnover. Danka will be its main customer as the primary distributor of Kodak copiers and printers.\n\"Danka's growth will be our growth,\" said Kodak co-chief operating officer Carl Kohrt.\nKohrt predicted Kodak's rump copier businesses would be profitable by the end of 1997 and that the transaction, netting Kodak about $600 million in cash, would be immediately accretive to earnings. The deal should close by December 31.  \nAnalyst Gary Schneider of Bear Stearns said he had hoped Kodak would have quit copiers entirely and will have to prove to Wall Street it can turn around the financial performance of the remaining copier businesses.\n\"The question is what kind of normalized earnings can you get out of those,\" he said.\nMonday's deal is just the latest bit of corporate trimming at Kodak, which has spun off and sold businesses, generating some $8 billion. The company has in the 1990s exited pharmaceuticals, household goods and chemicals.  \nThe company said last winter it wanted to exit or reposition its copier businesses because its financial performance was subpar and promised little hope for a turnaround as it stood.\nKohrt said the deal with Danka will stimulate sales of Kodak copiers. \"What we've really needed is pull-through from the market,\" he said.\nDanka chief executive Dan Doyle said Kodak's strong focus on big customers needing high-volume copiers and services dovetailed with Danka's traditional presence among low and middle-market customers.\nNews of the deal boosted Danka's American Depositary Receipts, which closed up 6-5/8 at 36-1/2. Kodak closed down 1/2 at 71-3/4.",

        "Text": "Cigarette companies, complaining of likely bad publicity, Friday dropped pre-trial opposition to punitive claims by the state of Florida in a multi-billion dollar anti-tobacco lawsuit.\nFlorida is seeking $1 billion or more from U.S. cigarette makers for actual costs incurred in its Medicaid healthcare programme for treating people afflicted with smoking-related ailments. Punitive damages, assuming a victory for the state, raise the potential losses to the industry substantially.\nThe state last month won the right to claim even further damages under Florida's anti-racketeering laws, a legal precedent in the spreading courtroom battle against tobacco companies. State lawyers have said the racketeering claims could cost cigarette makers tens of billions of dollars.\nA lawyer for Philip Morris Cos Inc., one of the defending tobacco companies, said in a news release that ending pre-trial opposition had no legal effect and that the industry had never paid punitive damages in any lawsuit.\nFlorida Attorney General Bob Butterworth hailed the action as victory and said the industry had made a major legal concession to delay harsh disclosures during a scheduled Jan. 24 hearing about industry marketing and medical research practices.\n\"I liken it to a criminal trial in which the defendant tries to suppress evidence that would prove him guilty,\" Butterworth said in an interview. \"They want to delay. It's their best short-term ploy.\"\nButterworth said he was forbidden by court order from detailing the damaging information in 27,000 pages of documents to have been presented on Jan. 24 but said 90 percent of the material came from industry internal documents. Much of the material was gathered by other attorneys general, many of whom are cooperating in anti-tobacco lawsuits filed by 18 states.\n\"It's nearly all their documents, all about their marketing practices, their science ... and they are giving up everything to avoid publicity,\" Butterworth said.\nPhilip Morris lawyer Gregory Little said a key reason for the industry's decision was a worry that the state lawyers would present evidence against cigarette makers during the hearing open to journalists. Tobacco lawyers would be severly restricted in defending against the evidence during the hearing, he said.\n\"... The January 24 hearing -- which was already window dressed for media consumption with a 442-page brief and 12 boxes of documents -- would have done nothing other than provide a platform for the plaintiffs lawyers to once again trumpet their case ...,\" Little said.\nHe accused anti-tobacco lawyers in Florida of leaking documents to reporters and polluting the pool of unbiased potential jurors needed for a fair trial.\nThe judge in the Florida trial, which is scheduled to begin Aug. 4 in West Palm Beach, Florida, last fall threw out 15 of the state government's original 18 claims.\nDefendants in the case, one of several such lawsuits brought by state governments scheduled to go to trial this year, include RJR Nabisco Holdings and the Brown & Williamson unit of B.A.T Industries of Britain.\nThe industry may receive another legal blow if a reported campaign by Brooke Group, parent of cigarette maker Ligget Group Inc., to settle Medicaid claims in a deal that could involve the exchange of confidential documents.\nLiggett was last year the first tobacco company to ever settle cigarette lawsuits in an accord with five states which had sued the industry to recoup health-care costs of smokers.",

The company competes against sector-leading McDonald's Corp and Wendy's International Inc.  \nComparable store sales, meaning those restaurants open at lease one year, rose 2.3 percent worldwide and 2.6 percent in the United States, Lowes said.\nGrand Met, the British branded-goods conglomerate, said last week operating profits at Burger King declined in the last fiscal year because of a European beef scare and a planned turndown in sales of restaurants to franchisees.\nEuropean sales last spring were hit by an outbreak of a disease attributed to contaminated British beef, especially hurting the company's hamburger outlets in Britain, France and Germany.  \nLowes said Burger King had responded by substituting for beef some chicken and other foods, including a vegetarian hamburger in Britain, to sustain sales in Europe.\n\"Our sales volumes are back where they were,\" Lowes said, referring to existing stores.\nThe executive said new stores to be added, including 75 to be built along British motorways in a deal with Granada Group Plc, would lift sales.\nBurger King was also negotiating other deals in Europe similar to the one with Granada, Lowes said.

Preferred dividends rose to $76 million in the third quarter from $16 million.\nTime Warner's stock showed no gain after the results but rose smartly later in the day after top executives told institutional investors that debt reduction was centre stage at the company.\nThe executives said Time Warner is in active discussions aimed at restructuring its troubled cable-television partnership with U S West Media Group.\nOne Time Warner executive said the talks with regional phone group U S West, 25 percent owner of most of Time Warner's cable systems, studios and the HBO pay-TV service, are likely to quicken and could yield a deal within months.\n\"We want to delever the company, lighten up on cable, and simplify the corporate capital structure,\" said the executive, speaking on a promise of anonymity.\nThe executives echoed Ted Turner, founder of Turner Broadcasting and now vice chairman of the combined company as well as its biggest individual shareholder. He has said he wants Time Warner's $17.5 billion debt halved.\nTime Warner now sees itself with the acquisition of Turner, producer of Cable News Network, The Cartoon Network and two studios, as primarily a programming group, the executives said.\nCapital-intensive cable operations are less important and ripe for partial divestment, the executives said. Investment capital can be better used outside cable, the executives said.\nEBITDA at Time Warner's cable operations, including those shared with with U S West, rose 14 percent to $512 million, the company said in its earnings report.\nBasic cable revenues rose sharply and advertising sales in cable also increased, the company said. With some 12.1 million customers, Time Warner is the nation's second-largest cable operator.\nTime Warner also had three summer movies grossing more than $100 million in U.S. ticket sales -- \"Twister,\" \"Eraser\" and \"A Time To Kill\" -- and its filmed entertainment unit had an EBITDA rise of 13 percent to $146 million.\nHBO's EBITDA rose 23 percent to $91 million. Sales to subscribers to satellite-television services led HBO's strong growth, senior executives said.\nThe publishing unit's EBITDA was $99 million, or 15 percent more than the $86 million posted in the year-ago quarter. Sports Illustrated, which produced a daily, limited-circulation version of its weekly magazine during the Atlanta Olympics, had particularly strong advertising sales.\nThe recorded music unit's EBITDA rose $1 million to $143 million from last year's quarter, when the division took an $85 million charge.

Turner Chairman Ted Turner will become vice chairman of the new company and will be the company's biggest shareholder.\nTime Warner is also opposing a proposal backed by New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani that Fox News be carried on a city-owned channel known as CrossWalks.\nGiulani has said that wide dissemination of Fox News throughout New York was important since it was the only all-news channel based within the city and was the source of hundreds of jobs.\nThe city's Franchise Concession and Review Committee is scheduled to vote Wednesday on whether or not the Turner-Time Warner deal should prompt a review of the Time Warner franchises.\nTime Warner executive Richard Aurelio said Monday that 90 percent of the regulators overseeing Time Warner's cable operations, the second largest in the United States, had passed without objection on the Turner-Time Warner merger.",

        "Text": "Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth said on Friday U.S. cigarette makers had delayed harsh revelations about the industry with a surprising decision to end pre-trial opposition to punitive damages in the state's multi-billion dollar anti-tobacco lawsuit.\nButterworth told Reuters a court hearing set for January 24 on the punitive claims to be added to any other jury awards would have made public information he alleged would have been highly damaging about the industry's marketing and medical research, contained in 27,000 pages of court-sealed documents.  \n\"I liken it to a criminal trial in which the defendant tries to suppress evidence that would prove him guilty,\" Butterworth said.  \"They want to delay.  It's their best short-term ploy.\"\nFlorida is one of 18 states suing U.S. cigarette companies to recoup billions of dollars spent through government healthcare programs on treating people made ill by smoking.  A trial in the Florida lawsuit filed by Butterworth is set for August 4.  \nPhilip Morris Cos Inc and other cigarette companies, complaining of likely bad publicity, earlier dropped pre-trial opposition to punitive claims by the State of Florida.  The state is seeking to recoup $1 billion or more for treating Medicaid costs from 1994.\nPhilip Morris Cos Inc lawyer Gregory Little said in a news release that the industry's decision had no legal effect and that the industry had never paid punitive damages in any lawsuit.  \nLittle said a key reason for the industry's decision was a worry that the state's lawyers would present evidence against cigarette makers during a public, pre-trial hearing.  Tobacco lawyers would be severly restricted in defending against the evidence during the hearing, he said.\n\"The lawyers for the state of Florida have demonstrated a remarkable propensity for trying their case in the media,\" Little said.\nHe accused anti-tobacco lawyers in Florida of leaking documents to reporters.  \n\"... The January 24 hearing -- which was already window dressed for media consumption with a 442-page brief and 12 boxes of documents -- would have done nothing other than provide a platform for the plaintiffs' lawyers to once again trumpet their case making it difficult for all parties to seat an unbiased jury,\" Little said.\nOther tobacco companies, including RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp, have accused anti-tobacco lawyers of selective and unfair leaks to the media.  \nButterworth said he was forbidden by court order from detailing the damaging information in the documents but said 90 percent of the material came from industry internal documents. Much of the material was gathered by other attorneys general, many of whom are cooperating in their anti-tobacco lawsuits.\n\"It's nearly all their documents, all about their marketing practices, their science ... and they are giving up everything to avoid publicity,\" Butterworth said.\n\"This is a 100 percent victory for the state,\" he said of the industry's decision.\n\"The only downside is that disclosure of the documents is delayed.\"\nA trial in the lawsuit is scheduled to begin on August 4 in West Palm Beach, Florida.",

A Silver King spokesman said the programming would emphasise local news and sports and would appear in some markets starting in about a year.\nSome executives have said Silver King, with stations in New York, Los Angeles, Miami and other leading markets, would initially target late-night and daytime slots with its own programmes. Start-up networks usually start building their programming with evening fare.\nHSN, which pays fees to Silver King to broadcast its retailing shows, will seek to win more slots on cable systems as Silver King's stations convert to traditional television programming, an HSN spokesman said.\nSilver King said the stock-swap merger was worth about $1.27 billion based on Friday's closing stock prices. The deal calls for each HSN shareholder to receive 0.45 of a share of Silver King common for each share of HSN stock owned.\n\"I think it's a very viable deal,\" said analyst Alvin Mirman of Commonwealth Associates. \"Diller reduces Home Shopping's distribution costs immediately. That could be a much as $40 million a year.\"\nMirman said he expects Diller to establish another network once he has overhauled the Silver King stations, which together comprise the sixth largest TV company in the United States.\nDiller is also buying Savoy Pictures, a money-losing studio that owns other television stations, for about $117 million in stock.\nAlthough HSN, based in St. Petersburg, Fla., invented television shopping in the early 1980s and was once a favourite on Wall Street, it has fallen to number two behind QVC Inc. as its sales have stagnated at about $1 billion annually.\nStill, its 24-hour programming reaches some 69 million households via cable television, broadcast station affiliates and satellite dish receivers.\nDiller, a highly successful television programmer credited with the Fox network's racy and successful shows, is also expected to revive Home Shopping Network's fortunes, analysts said.\nUnder the terms of the deal, each share of HSN Class B stock, which has 10 votes per share and is held solely by Liberty Media Corp., will be converted into 0.54 of a share of Silver King Class B Stock.\nSilver King said Liberty Media, in order to stay within rules on television-station ownership, will retain a 19.9 percent stake in HSN, under the 21 percent allowed by regulators. Liberty Media already owns a stake in Silver King.\nHome Shopping Network stock rose 12.5 cents to $11.375 on the New York Stock Exchange and Silver King fell $1.50 to $28 on Nasdaq.",

Preferred dividends rose to $76 million in the third quarter from $16 million.\nTime Warner's stock showed no gain after the results but rose smartly later in the day after top executives told institutional investors that debt reduction was centre stage at the company.\nThe executives said Time Warner is in active discussions aimed at restructuring its troubled cable-television partnership with U S West Media Group.\nOne Time Warner executive said the talks with regional phone group U S West, 25 percent owner of most of Time Warner's cable systems, studios and the HBO pay-TV service, are likely to quicken and could yield a deal within months.\n\"We want to delever the company, lighten up on cable, and simplify the corporate capital structure,\" said the executive, speaking on a promise of anonymity.\nThe executives echoed Ted Turner, founder of Turner Broadcasting and now vice chairman of the combined company as well as its biggest individual shareholder. He has said he wants Time Warner's $17.5 billion debt halved.\nTime Warner now sees itself with the acquisition of Turner, producer of Cable News Network, The Cartoon Network and two studios, as primarily a programming group, the executives said.\nCapital-intensive cable operations are less important and ripe for partial divestment, the executives said. Investment capital can be better used outside cable, the executives said.\nEBITDA at Time Warner's cable operations, including those shared with with U S West, rose 14 percent to $512 million, the company said in its earnings report.\nBasic cable revenues rose sharply and advertising sales in cable also increased, the company said. With some 12.1 million customers, Time Warner is the nation's second-largest cable operator.\nTime Warner also had three summer movies grossing more than $100 million in U.S. ticket sales -- \"Twister,\" \"Eraser\" and \"A Time To Kill\".\nTime Warner shares rose $1.125 to $42 in New York Stock Exchange Trading.",

Daynard said two other class-action suits, another in Miami and the second in Pennsylvania, were also scheduled to go to trial this year.\n\"This is a significant stage,\" said University of Colorado School of Law professor Christopher Mueller.  \nFlight attendants lawyer Stanley Rosenblatt of Miami said 25,000 to 60,000 flight attendants would likely be included in the suit out of an estimated 300,000 who worked for U.S. airlines before in-flight smoking was banned.\nThe suit alleges that second-hand smoke causes cardiac conditions, cancer and 21 other ailments. Rosenblatt and Daynard said scientific findings had established links between those ailments and second-hand smoke that were strong enough to stand up in a jury trial.  \n\"That's a very big if,\" said Michael York, an attorney for the tobacco industry. \"If he were successful in that, he has to come back and prove that second-hand smoke caused individual injuries.\"\nRosenblatt said damages, if any, would be set in follow-up trials after the completion of the June 2 trial, which he estimated would run two to three months in Dade County Court. Categories of claims, such as those of people suffering with emphysma, would likely be determined separately, he said.  \nTobacco attorneys had in recent months pressed Rosenblatt to spend heavily on a national media campaign, using television and popular magazines, but Dade County Circuit Judge Robert Kaye ruled that mail notification was sufficient.\nDaynard and Mueller said the tobacco industry, in expectations it would beat Rosenblatt, wanted as many potential claimaints involved in the class-action suit since those people then would not be able to sue independently.\n\"We think the entire case is meritless,\" York said.\nRosenblatt said any claimants who did not write and ask to be excluded from the class-action lawsuit would be included. Typically, no more than five to 10 percent of class-action claimants drop out, legal experts said.",

Lawton Chiles, Florida is suing cigarette makers for $1 billion, or more in costs incurred from treating smokers through the state's Medicaid healthcare program.  \nThe state has also won the right to press for punitive damages under a state racketeering law if it can prove tobacco companies such as RJR Nabisco and the Brown & Williamson unit of B.A.T Industries of Britain conspired to hide the health risks of tobacco from customers.\nThe governor is also pressing to raise cigarette taxes and backed restrictions made public this week on tobacco-related advertising on Florida's state roads.\nSome two dozen state governments and other local governments are suing tobacco companies to recover monies spent on treating tobacco-related illnesses.\n\"It's ironic,\" said April Herrle, spokeswoman for the governor. \"This is a backdoor admission by the industry that nicotine is addictive, something it denies.\"\nShe said the state expects the countersuit to be dismissed.\nLast week, the tobacco companies were rebuffed by the trial judge in the case when they sought to use the state's cigarette-making record as a partial defense in the approaching trial.",

Using RICO may give the state a deeper reach,\" Mueller said.\nThe state's RICO law, similar to a federal statute and laws on the books in other states, would allow Florida officials to seek damages from before 1994, when a state law was passed that opened the way for Florida to try to recoup money spent on treating poor smokers.\nFlorida is one of 16 states and several big cities, including New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, that have sued tobacco companies to recoup costs of health care for poor smokers.\nTexas and now Florida are among a handful of states that are also using RICO laws to bolster their claims against Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the world's biggest cigarette maker, and other tobacco companies. Florida filed the added claims under RICO laws on Nov 4.\nMueller said use of RICO could add to the industry's potential financial losses by allowing Florida to make claims to recoup costs of treating smokers from before 1994.\nFlorida Attorney General Bob Butterworth is set to appear on Friday in county court in West Palm Beach, a spokesman said. He and attorneys for tobacco companies will argue over the industry's request that the RICO claim be dismissed.\nIt was unclear when a ruling would be made, a court official said.\nPresiding Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Harold Cohen recently dismissed 15 counts of the state's 18-count lawsuit that claims the industry was liable for state-paid hospital costs from lung cancer and other smoking-related diseases. The full case is expected to come to trial next year.\nA Jacksonville, Fla., jury last summer handed the tobacco industry its biggest loss in a court case yet when it awarded $750,000 to a lung cancer sufferer who had smoked for half a century. The defendant was the Brown & Williamson unit of Britain's B.A.T Industries Plc.\nIn Washington, anti-smoking groups said divesting tobacco investments was being actively considered by a growing number of institutional investors concerned by both the ethics and the financial outlook for the industry.",

He declined to say when the British firm hoped to begin production.\nWhile the letter of intent showed a major commitment to working with BP, even if the ethylene project developed it did not mean Shanghai Petrochemical would slow cooperation with other foreign firms, said board of directors secretary Cai Hongping.\n\"It's not like love with a marriage of one husband and one wife,\" he said. \"I think Shanghai Petrochemical will not stop looking for other partners.\"",

We never stopped,\" he said.\nRelations between Beijing and Tokyo have been strained this year by a controversial visit by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to a shrine to Japan's war dead and by a territorial dispute over an island group in the East China Sea.\nWhile Chinese state media have been quick to condemn what they call resurgent Japanese militarism, diplomats say Beijing is keen not to allow the disputes to harm an economic relationship in which the soft yen loans are an important part.\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai earlier this week warned Japan not to use financial assistance as a form of political pressure, saying to do so could only harm ties.\nThe yen loans, widely seen in China as a form of reparation for the suffering inflicted by Japan during World War Two, have themselves been a source of dispute.\nThe rise of the value of the yen in 1994 and 1995 -- which sent the cost of the loans soaring -- prompted howls of Chinese complaints and demands to be allowed to repay in U.S. dollars.\nTokyo refused, but the yen's later decline helped blunt the issue as a potential cause of conflict and both sides have recently shown new willingness to cooperate on other issues.\nPrime Minister Hashimoto has been reported as promising to consider lifting the freeze on grant-in-aid to China, but Sadoshima said that issue would not be discussed by the loan mission.\n\"That's not my department,\" Sadoshima said.\n($1 = 113 yen)",

Regulations or laws on blood administration would also be published, Dai said.\nBeijing's campaign to promote ethical progress, regarded by analysts as a bid to bolster the authority of the ruling Communist Party and boost socialist values weakened by economic reforms, would help in China's fight against AIDS, Dai said.\nOverseas experience had shown that condoms were an effective way to prevent AIDS and China had launched an experimental campaign to promote condom use in Shanghai in 1994, said the health ministry official.\n\"The result was not very good,\" he said. \"Many people feel willing to use condoms if they are free... but not if they are sold.\"",

        "Text": "A Chinese court took less than four hours on Wednesday to convict prominent dissident and former student leader Wang Dan of plotting to overthrow the government and sentenced him to 11 years in prison.\nThe Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court found Wang guilty of conspiring to subvert the Chinese government, the Xinhua news agency said. He faced a maximum penalty of death.\n\"Sufficient evidence, which includes written materials, witness accounts, recorded tape and criminal technical appraisal, were shown at the court,\" Xinhua quoted the judge as saying after the trial.\nWang, 27, was also deprived of his political rights for two years, Xinhua said, quoting the verdict.\n\"Wang candidly confessed his activities,\" Xinhua said, adding that he received funds from overseas hostile forces, gave financial aid to families of jailed dissidents and tried to set up an \"opposition force\" by uniting illegal organisations.\nCharges against Wang were backed by testimony by another dissident, Liu Xiaobo, Xinhua said. It did not elaborate. Liu was sent this month to a labour camp for three years.\n\"His criminal fact is clear, and the evidence is conclusive,\" Xinhua said quoting the verdict against Wang. \"He instigated people by saying that 'It is time we turn our words into actions'.\"\nThe verdict was issued just four hours after the trial began. Foreign reporters and legal experts were barred from attending the trial in western Beijing.\nSecurity was tight around the court building, with dozens of police preventing the public from approaching the building.\nEarlier on Wednesday, the dissident's father said the family would appeal if Wang were convicted.\n\"We will definitely appeal... We will not give in,\" Wang Xianzeng told reporters just hours before the start of the proceedings.\n\"He is definitely innocent,\" he said as he left his home with the dissident's mother, Wang Lingyun, to go to the court.\n\"Speech can't overthrow the government,\" he said.\nWang's mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, attended the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister were allowed to sit in.\nWang Lingyun said on Tuesday she expected Wang to receive a harsh sentence although he would plead not guilty.\nThe mother had said the dissident was calm and mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, although she has said his health had deteriorated since he vanished into detention in May 1995.\nWang Dan faced a minimum 10-year sentence and a maximum penalty of death.\nThe New York-based Human Rights Watch said last week the chances of acquittal were slim because Wang has not had adequate time to prepare a defence.\nHuman Rights Watch attacked the trial on Tuesday as a sign of the Chinese leadership's increasing intolerance of dissent.\nWang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.\nHe was politically active again after his parole in 1993, defying police surveillance to join a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of those still jailed for their part in the 1989 protests.\nChina has recently cracked down on the few remaining dissidents who have not fled into exile or been jailed.",

        "Text": "Like an ageing prizefighter, AT&T Corp is destined to slug it out with vigorous rivals both big and small in the $75 billion long distance telephone arena, with no lift in earnings performance in sight.\nThough AT&T has just started to improve its marketing punch, share analysts say by the time it shows up in earnings it will be facing fresh opponents -- muscular regional Bells.\n\"It is hard to find a positive medium-term outlook for AT&T,\" said Bette Massick of brokers Bear Stearns, adding that more attractive stocks could be found elsewhere.  \nThursday's third quarter earnings were in line with analysts' estimates, revised after September's profits warning.  But few analysts give hope for a quick profit rebound now that the company's fortunes are so clearly tied to its long distance marketplace.\nAT&T earlier reported a 12 percent earnings per share decline to $0.84 from $0.96 a year ago -- with increased competition and higher marketing expenses hitting long distance -- while financial services sank into losses.  \n\"I don't see much earnings improvement next quarter or in the first two 1997 quarters,\" said Simon Flannery of brokers J.P. Morgan.  The shares were 1/2 lower at $39-3/8.\nAT&T said it has been encouraged by early responses to its new $0.15 a minute flat price for long distance, and analysts say this should stem the weakness for now.\nAT&T has a higher proportion of revenues from the consumer long distance market place than its two archrivals MCI Communications Corp and Sprint Corp.  \nThe spinoff of Lucent Technologies Inc in September and of NCR Corp at the end of 1996, plus numerous unit sales, can only tighten the dependence.\nCompanies like GTE Corp -- which took half a million long distance customers in its first six months -- and Southern New England Telecommunications Corp are entering the market in a big way, mostly in the consumer area.\nThey join hundreds of tiny aggressive companies like Excel Communications Inc, which lease the circuits of the big players and then compete with them at low prices.  \nBy the second half of 1997, dependent on the state of a legal tussle over U.S. Federal Communications Commission resale rules, regional Bells will be starting to enter the long distance market themselves.\nBy this time AT&T, like other long distance players, is hoping to offer local calling using the circuits of the regional Bells. But the legal challenge led by GTE may succeed in shutting the FCC out of the resale pricing process.\n\"If so, it will cost AT&T more to get into the local market,\" Massick said.  \nMajor players by then will be starting to offer packages including wireless, local and long distance and in some cases satellite or cable television too, all on one bill.\nThis should shut out some of the small resellers and throw the fight onto brand names, where AT&T should be strong -- but the outcome is far from clear, analysts say.\nIn the meantime, they are hoping for strong action at the loss-making Universal Card credit card unit.\n\"The credit card business was very disappointing; that's something to watch going forward,\" Flannery said.",

Donnelley & Sons Co. He may be up to the job, but the market will be kept guessing for 18 months while Allen serves out his time.\n\"He may be exactly what they need, but we won't know for a while,\" said consultant Jeffrey Kagan of Kagan Telecom.  \nAnalysts and consultants say Walter is well respected but has never faced the scale of challenge he will find at AT&T, which bestrides the crossroads of communication, software, computing and the Internet.\n\"AT&T is the biggest battleship you have ever seen. Donnelley is not a small company, but AT&T is 10 times the revenues and has three times the employees,\" said David Goodtree, a consultant at Forrester Research.\nAT&T appointed Walter as its new president and chief operating officer, effective November 1.  \nBut he will not take over as chief executive from Allen until January 1998. Four months later he will become chairman at AT&T's annual meeting.\n\"Allen does have an image problem, though I don't have that opinion of him,\" said Barry Sine of SBC Warburg, who cut his rating on AT&T stock to hold from buy today. \"The long handover period is an issue for the market.\"\nAT&T's share in the $75 billion long distance telephone market has fallen to around 55 percent today from 60 percent two years ago. Marketing stumbles hurt earnings in the recent third quarter, and investors are losing patience, analysts say.  \nAT&T stock was down two points at 37-7/8 at noon EDT/1600 GMT in heavy volume. Adjusted for the split-off of Lucent Technologies Inc, AT&T shares have fallen 16 percent this year, about the same as the broad market has risen.\nSine said of Walter, \"This is not a candidate to lead the rally.\"\nAnalysts say top candidates to succeed Allen, such as George Fisher of Eastman Kodak, may have been put off by the lengthy 18-month transition time while Allen remains in charge.  \n\"I heard the reason Fisher didn't take the job was the 18-month delay before taking the reins,\" Kagan said.\nHowever, a source close to AT&T, speaking on condition of anonymity, said no tentative or firm offer was made to any candidate who subsequently withdrew. AT&T declined comment on the matter.\n\"I was expecting 12 months (handover) at most,\" said Chris Landis, an analyst at consultancy Telechoice Inc and a former AT&T executive. \"I think most insiders were too.\"  \nWalter has qualities and experience that AT&T will be able to make good use of, analysts said. His printing company specialized in high volumes and quick turnarounds.\n\"That's a good quality to have at AT&T because you are talking about billions of phone calls a month,\" said Goodtree.\nDonnelley is a formidable user of technology and has used telecommunications to transform its business. It is also a significant customer of AT&T.\nCable & Wireless Plc Chief Executive Richard Brown spoke favorably of Walter.  \n\"I think AT&T is fortunate to get John Walter,\" Brown told Reuters. \"John Walter is a leader...He know the telecoms world but he is not directly involved. He's a quick study.\"\nOn the downside, there is the huge leap of scale and the different nature of AT&T's business. Donnelley is a project-based company, while AT&T is a process-based company requiring different management techniques.\nWhile Walter has made great inroads in the business market where Donnelley finds its customers, he has little experience in consumer markets where AT&T is having its biggest trouble fighting off aggressive competitors.\nIn an interview this summer, Allen told Business Week magazine that he would be prepared to step down early \"if we find God, or something short of that..\"\nJohn Walter has found some adherents at AT&T, but the stock market is not yet ready for a conversion.",

For for shareholders, it means faster earnings growth, analysts said.\n\"This is not a pebble we're throwing onto a quiet pool. It is a big rock, and it's going to make a big splash,\" Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of British Telecommunications Plc, told a news conference in New York.\nThe deal values all of Washington,D.C.-based MCI at a total $25.2 billion. But as British Telecom already owns 20 percent, it will issue Concert stock and cash worth $20.1 billion for the 80 percent it does not own. Holders of this MCI stake will thus control 33 percent of the stock in the combined company.\nBecause the companies have already worked together for three years, they expect the merged company to function well.\n\"Mergers don't always work, but this one will,\" Vallance added.\nAT&T, which would be the hardest hit by a financially muscular enlarged rival, said it was confident any MCI/British Telecom deal would receive proper scrutiny by the U.S. government and called on both U.S. and European regulators to condition approval of the deal on a further freeing of competition in British Telecom's home market.\nAlready strong in long distance, MCI hopes to use BT's service and back-up expertise, plus plenty of cash, to help take a big chunk of the $100 billion a year U.S. local calling market from the regional Bells.\nThat market is expected to gradually open to competition following legislation earlier this year. Since 1984 it had been the monopoly of the seven regional Bells.\nMCI Chief Executive Bert Roberts said he was confident the combination with British Telecom would win the approval of federal regulators, noting that \"the U.K. is the most competitive telecommunications market in the world.\"\nHe added that the deal would result in lower expenditures for both companies because \"costs will be reduced by building networks once, not twice.\" The companies expect to save $1.5 billion in costs over five years.\nEmployees, usually tense during mergers, can relax.\n\"Minimal job cuts, that is the joy of this. MCI will operate in the Americas, and BT will operate in the U.K and the rest of the world,\" Vallance told Reuters.\nConcert Plc would be one of the world's largest telecommunications companies, with 43 million business and residential customers in 70 countries.\n\"The complementary strengths and skills of BT and MCI will enable Concert to take full advantage of the great opportunities provided by the forthcoming liberalization of the telecommunications market in the U.S. and Europe,\" said Vallance.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, which has yet to be approved by regulatory authorities on either side of the Atlantic, MCI shareholders would receive 0.54 new American Depositary Shares in the new combined group for every MCI share. Each Concert ADS is equivalent to one British Telecom American Depositary Share and $6 cash.\nBritish Telecom's ADSs closed at $55.50 in New York on Friday, giving a value of $30 per MCI share, plus $6 in cash per share before the effect of a buyback by British Telecom that is part of the deal, MCI Chief Financial Officer Doug Maine told Reuters.\nBritish Telecom said Concert will buy back up to 10 percent of its shares after the deal closes. The maximum buyback would increase the value of the deal to MCI shareholders to $39.60 per MCI share. MCI's stock closed Friday at $30.25 on Nasdaq.\nThe new company, incorporated in Britain, would have headquarters in London and Washington and operate under the British Telecom and MCI brand names.\nBritish Telecom has been looking for a major acquisition since its proposed merger with British rival Cable and Wireless failed in May. It had been keen to forge that deal because it would have given it access to the lucrative Asian telecoms market -- the world's fastest-growing market.\nAnalysts now expect British Telecom and MCI to start making overtures to major Asian players such as Japan's giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.\nBut while seeking an Asian partner, MCI is putting another one on a backburner.\nMCI is to cut its stake in a U.S. satellite venture with Australian media tycoon Rupert Murdoch to 20 percent from 50 percent, and will not increase its stake in Murdoch's News Corp as originally expected.\n\"It is unlikely you will see us increasing our investment (in News Corp),\" Roberts told Reuters.\nMCI paid $1.35 billion for a stake of just under 9 percent, and could increase it to 13 percent with another $1 billion investment.\nRoberts added that if U.S. regulatory permission could be obtained, he may even sell the $700 million license that goes with the U.S. direct-to-home broadcast satellite to Murdoch.",

Chairman Robert Allen is likely step down early to help attract a talented enough successor to take the helm of the nation's largest long-distance company, sources close to AT&T said Friday.\nThey said the person chosen to succeed Alex Mandl, who resigned as AT&T president and chief operating officer in August to head a small wireless communications company, would expect to be able to succeed Allen, 61, well before the four years still to run on his contract.\n\"I think it is fair to assume that,\" said one source, who declined to be identified.\nAT&T would not comment on the search for Mandl's successor and whether the candidate would succeed Allen, who is also chief executive officer.\n\"The search by the board is a private matter and we won't comment beyond that,\" said AT&T spokesman Jim Byrnes.\nAnalysts said one possibility was that Allen would split off the role of chief executive to the new president in a year or so but retain his chairmanship until retirement.\n\"I expect the (AT&T) system would allow and wish Allen to stay on in a senior official position for some time,\" said Mark Bruneau at COBA MID, a consulting firm.\nAn ambitious candidate would want to make an early impact on the strategic direction of AT&T, one source said, noting that the fast-changing telecommunications market may be barely recognisable in four years.\nThe sources declined to comment on possible candidates, but some names already mentioned in the news media seem to have ruled themselves out.\n\"There is probably more speculation out there than truth in the media at this juncture\" on the candidates, one source said.\nTwo candidates mentioned by the New York Times on Friday ruled themselves out. William Esrey, chairman of long-distance company Sprint Corp., said through a spokesman he was unaware of being a candidate for the AT&T job.\n\"His contract with Sprint precludes working with competitors for several years after he leaves the company,\" the spokesman said.\nSimilarly, Hughes Electronics Corp. said its president, Michael Armstrong, was unaware of being an AT&T candidate.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Eastman Kodak Co. Chairman George Fisher and former AT&T director James Barksdale, now chairman of Netscape Communications Corp., also ruled themselves out.\nThe AT&T board meets Wednesday, a day before the company reports third-quarter earnings, and may discuss the issue then.\nAllen, a 40-year AT&T career veteran, would be reluctant to depart early but said in a recent press interview that he would consider doing so if a perfect candidate came along.\nExpectations of an early departure by Allen were fanned by AT&T's warning in September when it said earnings per share for the third quarter may be 10 percent below analysts' expectations.\nThe warning crowned a rough year for AT&T, which incurred the wrath of politicians, the media and the public for announcing 40,000 job cuts in January. Meanwhile, the rise in the stock price that job cuts often produce has not materialised, so Wall Street and investors are not happy either.\nAT&T's split into three parts is proceeding as planned, leaving the company to concentrate on its core long-distance telecommunications business, where competition is heating up.\nWhile the Dow Jones industrial average is up nearly 17 percent so far this year, AT&T shares -- adjusted for the company's breakup -- are off 16 percent.\nAT&T has hired executive search groups Korn Ferry and Spencer Stuart to seek an outside candidate. Officials at both firms declined to comment.",

Ameritech said chief executive Notebaert was abroad and unavailable for immediate comment.\nAs a regional Bell chief executive he has powerful credentials for the post, but it remains unclear whether AT&T's search is focused within the industry, or would be broadened to a candidate with powerful marketing skills from some other industry.  AT&T, and the two executive search firms involved, Korn Ferry International and Spencer Stuart, have declined comment consistently on the succession issue.  \nHowever, while the guessing game over successors has held sway in the press, it has been a snooze for investors, said analyst Bill Deatherage of brokers Bear Stearns.\n\"This is discussed much more in the press than by investors,\" Deatherage said.\nHe said that even if investors knew the candidate, it would be months at least before he or she would be able to have a discernible effect on the huge inertia in the corporation.\nSome analysts have suggested that Allen may stay on as chairman while the new recruit rapidly steps up to become chief executive, but Landis thought Allen's continued presence would overshadow the new executive.",

He said that News Corp was aware of MCI's position.\nThis is all a world away from the first flush of enthusiasm when Murdoch and Roberts announced a broad-ranging alliance in May 1995.\nThe plan was to take the Australian magnate's publishing and television expertise and put it together with MCI's communications network and marketing skill, especially in the emerging market of the Internet.\nBut so far, the venture has produced some duds.\nMCI's electronic malls on the Internet are now closed, and News Corp's ideas of producing supermarket tabloids to lure middle-aged readers to the Internet have been shelved.\nLow-level cross-promotion, like advertising MCI calling cards in Murdoch's U.S. TV Guide, have continued.\nThe crux of the problem, analysts say, is that there never was much overlap between MCI's blue-chip business clients and Murdoch's blue-collar sports and publishing expertise.\n\"BT/MCI is going after the High Street, not Melrose Place,\" said Danny Briere, an industry analyst at consultancy Telechoice.\nThe satellite offspring American Sky Broadcasting (ASkyB) has been a problem child, expensive and slow to develop in comparison with some rivals.\nIn January, MCI and News Corp said they would offer digital television direct to the home across the U.S. market within two years, using the $700 million license MCI won in an auction.\nBut the same month, AT&T announced an alliance with General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Electronics  DirecTV, a company that was already offering digital satellite services, and which now has two million subscribers.\nMCI is clearly taking a second look.\n\"We would be willing, consistent with our lowering our investment position (in ASkyB), to move those to News Corp. That will take FCC approval,\" Roberts said.\nBT Chairman Sir Iain Vallance said he expected to look hard for new partners to fill out the global telecommunications alliance in Asia.\n\"I think we will be more attractive to Asian partners than we would had we stayed separate,\" Vallance told Reuters in an interview. He declined to say which companies he had his eye on, but sources close to the company say Japan's NTT Corp. is considered the real prize.\nVallance said any partner would tie up closely to the business venture first.\n\"I think it is more likely that, in the first instance, we would invite partnership in Concert Communications Services rather than the parent itself,\" he said.",

MCI One users are five times as likely to take cellular and calling cards than when services are billed separately.  \nIt is not just a land war. MCI has cross promotions with Northwest Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines Inc, seeing overlaps between frequent fliers and heavy users of calling cards and wireless services.\nOffering free air miles is much cheaper than offering cash, but just as alluring to certain markets.\n\"Our line-up gives us access to 70 percent of frequent fliers,\" said Maine.\nMaine said that AT&T and Sprint Corp have been mining their databanks too, and the whole industry will have a headstart against the regional Bells, which are much newer to the game, when markets are all open to competition.\nDespite all its data warehousing, MCI still makes errors.\nMCI said it is in the process of revamping its paging services, which resell the networks of Paging Network Inc and Mobile Telecommunications Technologies Corp after it discovered heavy churn.",

In Europe, it would be roughly the same size as Deutsche Telekom AG.\nMCI directors, meeting on Saturday in \"The Mausoleum,\" the name MCI staff give to their granite-domed Washington headquarters, have reason to be well pleased with the deal.\nAnalysts say MCI management will be left in charge of the U.S. market, and be given more money to fight in new markets and defend existing ones in the new deregulated environment.\n\"It is inconceivable to me that BT would change the MCI management,\" Kagan said.\nFor MCI the deal brings a 30 percent fillip to a stock price that had languished for almost two years, but for BT the benefits may be more symbolic than actual, analysts say.\n\"What does BT get for its $22 billion?\" asked David Goodtree of Forrester Research.\n\"You only need a global strategy to serve big businesses and they already have their Concert venture to serve that market. Other markets are regional,\" he said.\nEconomies of scale would be hard to find.

Wednesday said earnings rose 9 percent in the third quarter, boosted by strong demand for new phone lines from people setting up businesses or hooking up computers at home.\nThe results were in line with expectations, but GTE's stock jumped as investors cheered the report from the nation's largest local telephone company, as well a court ruling late on Tuesday that suspended key parts of federal rules designed to foster competition in local phone markets.\nOther local phone company stocks also rose after the ruling by a three-judge appeals court panel in St. Louis. The judges said they had \"serious doubts\" about the Federal Communication Commission's authority to impose its pricing policies.\nThe FCC rules, among other things, would require the Baby Bells and other local carriers to lease their phone lines to new competitors at steep discounts of up to 25 percent.\nAnalysts said state regulators were likely to call for lower discounts. The appellate panel put the new rules on hold while it considers a court challenge to the FCC's plan.\nThe challenge to the FCC rules had been spearheaded by GTE, which was joined by some of the Baby Bells, other local carriers and state regulators.\n\"(The legal challenge) improves the probability for getting higher prices to resell local networks than under the FCC guidance,\" said Bette Massick at brokers Bear Stearns.\nGTE jumped $3.625 to $42.25 in consolidated afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nOther Bell stocks that rose included BellSouth, up $2.50 to $38.875, Bell Atlantic, ahead $2.125 to $60.875, Nynex, which gained $1.625 to $44.50, Ameritech, up $1.75 to $56.125 and Pacific Telesis, which added $1.375 to $34.625, all on the NYSE.\nIn its report, Stamford, Conn.-based GTE said net income rose to $756 million, or 78 cents a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $695 million, or 72 cents a share, in the 1995 period.\nThe results matched analysts' forecasts of 78 cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks estimates. The 1995 figures included a gain of $11 million, or 1 cent a share, from the sale of secondary telephone properties.\nSales grew 7 percent to $5.34 billion from $5.0 billion.\nIn addition to strong line demand, GTE cited growth in its cellular and long-distance services.\n\"The continued pace of our revenue growth, driven by record line growth as well as strong demand for new and enhanced services, is particularly encouraging,\" Chairman Charles Lee said in a statement.\nThe number of domestic access lines grew 7 percent in the quarter, with more than half the growth in the residential side of the business from additional lines to the home, GTE said.\nGTE said its number of cellular customers grew almost 5 percent in the quarter, while cellular revenue surged 15 percent.\nIt also said it doubled its number of long-distance customers to more than 500,000 from the end of the second quarter.",

Its share in the $75 billion market has fallen to around 55 percent from 60 two years ago.\n\"They haven't had the level of execution on the consumer side that we should have seen,\" said consultant Chris Landis of TeleChoice, who is also an ex-AT&T executive.  \nAT&T has made repeated attempts to make money in online services and the Internet, but has sold off almost all its creative content efforts and has retreated to a core offering of Internet access.\nFor every acquisition that worked well, like the 1994 purchase of McCaw Cellular, there have been others that failed, like the $7.5 billion 1991 takeover of NCR Corp.\nAdjusted for the split-off of Lucent Technologies Inc, AT&T shares have fallen 16 percent this year, about the same as the broad market has risen.  \nAmong Walter's favorite quotes: \"When you hire, hire people better than you and then you'll build a company of giants. Hire people worse than you and you'll disappear.\"\nPrinting industry analysts say Walter has used technology very effectively to make Donnelley grow, but some say growth came at a price.\n\"A lot of things have been going wrong,\" said one analyst, citing the lower earnings outlook and falling stock price.\nBut analyst Rudolf Hokanson of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said Walter was an effective manager.\n\"He tried to make people more accountable, tried to flatten some of the reporting structure,\" said Hokanson.",

Analysts expect dilution of $450 miilion to $650 million in 1997.\nKrause said he was encouraged that churn, or customer turnover, was declining in its long distance operations, particularly when others were being hit hard.\n\"(Nevertheless) churn rates still exceed what anyone would hope they would be,\" he said.\nAT&T Corp said in September that high churn in this competitive marketplace was one of the reasons that it predicted an earnings shortfall for the third quarter.\nKrause said Sprint's marketing encouraged customers to remain with the company.",

It was in a position to get the terms it wanted.\n\"There aren't a lot of MFS's out there,\" Ebbers said.\n\"He (Ebbers) had the only one sizeable company to merge with whose stock we really wanted (to own),\" James Crowe, chief executive of MFS, told reporters.\nWorldCom stock soared a heady 57 percent a year over the last ten years. MFS has grown 41 percent a year in the three years since it was floated.  \nEbbers said savings and new market opportunities would mean the deal would pay for itself within five or six years, though for the first three years, 1997-1999, earnings per share would be diluted, but solidly accretive thereafter.\nWorries that the stock transaction was too generous for MFS hit Worldcom stock, which was 3-3/4 or 15 percent lower at 22-5/8 in early afternoon. MFS soared 10 to 44-7/8, with both atop the active shares list on Nasdaq.\nEbbers said communicating the deal's advantages may take time. \"If that happens we will have a significantly increased stock price from where we are today,\" he said.  \nUUNET, the internet service provider which MFS completed buying earlier this month, will have the biggest savings.\nNow it can provide both local and long distance connections without having to pay fees on outside networks. These fees had previously swallowed up half of its revenues.     Most\nimportantly, the combined company MFS WorldCom can present a comprehensive business package without having to use the networks or pay the fees of others.\nEnd-to-end service is the promise of the U.S. deregulation which became law early this year, but neither AT&T Corp nor any regional Bell can yet achieve it either because of regulatory checklists or negotiating tussles.\n\"We think this gives us at least a two-year headstart over our competitors,\" Ebbers said.\nBy being first, Ebbers expects to reap wholesale business from the regional Bells and GTE Corp, companies which at a retail level are its competitors.",

        "Text": "Third quarter results at both MCI Communications Corp and Sprint Corp will be restrained by the cost of new ventures, and in Sprint's case the issue of new shares will lower per share earnings.\nBut analysts say both have so far escaped the problems which have hit AT&T Corp in the consumer long distance market, and which led to AT&T's profit warning in September.\n\"MCI will have increased earnings, but will continue the second quarter trend of slower long distance volume growth,\" Massick said Bette Massick of brokerage Bear Stearns.  \nSprint's earnings per share are expected to be lower than a year ago because of investment in the international Global One venture and in Personal Communications Services.\nSprint's shares in issue will rise to about 435 million, from 351 million a year ago, because of stock issued to partners Deutsche Telekom  DTK.CN and French Telecom.\nMCI's heavy investment in media, Internet and satellite services with News Corp Ltd is not expected to break even for several years.\n\"The dilutive effects of the MCI ventures will increase year over year,\" Massick said.  \nAT&T said on September 24 that earnings per share could be as much as 10 percent below analysts' forecasts of $0.92 per share for the third quarter.  If this fear were realized, it would report earnings of $0.83, 13.5 percent below the $0.96 of a year earlier.\nAnalysts say AT&T's problems were an expensive and flawed consumer market strategy of trying to win customers by offering them $100 checks and the competitive effect of small, fast-growing resellers and \"dial around\" services.  \nResellers include companies like Excel Communications Inc, which have produced 50 percent-plus annual revenue growth by using independent sales representatives to sell to friends, family and associates.\nDial around is so named because customers use a 1-800 number to access a rival service advertising cut price rates for long distance or international calling, without switching their long distance provider.\nThe long distance giants do not lose the customer, but notice a fall in average billable revenue.  \nMCI expects higher customer turnover in consumer markets because of increased competition. But neither it nor Sprint depends as heavily on the consumer market as AT&T does.\nMerrill Lynch analyst Dan Reingold said in a research report that demand demand for Sprint's services is robust.\n\"Our forecast minute (of use) growth rate of 9.1 percent should be almost double the industry average...indicating that Sprint continues to take market share,\" Reingold said.\nBy contrast he expected AT&T minutes of use to grow by 6.2 percent from a year ago, and revenue on this to rise just 1.5 percent.\nThis growth gap of 4.7 percentage points would exceed the 3.4 percent of the second quarter, he said.\nAnalysts say Sprint and MCI are not immune to the threat from dial around and resellers, but in any case the threat will be contained in the next two or three years.\n\"I think the idea of packages or bundles of services will be very much a threat to the small dial around competition because they won't be able to compete up and down the product chain,\" said Guy Woodlief of brokers Dean Witter Reynolds.  \nAT&T's adoption of a flat rate 15 cent long distance charge should help it regain market share, especially against Sprint, which charges a flat 25 cents during the day.\nSuch is the danger is adopting a clear pricing policy -- when more than one major competitor does it comparisons become easy and can lead to a downward spiral in calling charges.\n\"Given AT&T's brand position in the market place, it is going to remain a formidable competitor,\" said Woodlief.

        "Text": "British Telecom and MCI Communications on Sunday announced a $20 billion merger, using the largest cross-border takeover deal in history to spawn a global telecommunications powerhouse.\nThe merged company, to be called Concert Plc, creates the world's second-largest telecommunications group, based on market capitalisation, behind Japan's NTT Corp.\nValued at $54 billion based on Friday's closing stock prices, Concert is neck-and-neck with U.S. long-distance leader AT&T Corp., which is MCI's arch-rival in the super-competitive U.S. market.\nFor customers, the deal promises better service and lower international calling charges, while for businesses it means a company that can support them wherever they are. For for shareholders, it means faster earnings growth, analysts said.\n\"This is not a pebble we're throwing onto a quiet pool. It is a big rock, and it's going to make a big splash,\" Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of British Telecommunications Plc, told a news conference in New York.\nThe deal values all of Washington,D.C.-based MCI at a total $25.2 billion. But as British Telecom already owns 20 percent, it will issue Concert stock and cash worth $20.1 billion for the 80 percent it does not own. Holders of this MCI stake will thus control 33 percent of the stock in the combined company.\nBecause the companies have already worked together for three years, they expect the merged company to function well.\n\"Mergers don't always work, but this one will,\" Vallance added.\nAT&T, which would be the hardest hit by a financially muscular enlarged rival, said it was confident any MCI/British Telecom deal would receive proper scrutiny by the U.S. government and called on both U.S. and European regulators to condition approval of the deal on a further freeing of competition in British Telecom's home market.\nAlready strong in long distance, MCI hopes to use BT's service and back-up expertise, plus plenty of cash, to help take a big chunk of the $100 billion a year U.S. local calling market from the regional Bells.\nThat market is expected to gradually open to competition following legislation earlier this year. Since 1984 it had been the monopoly of the seven regional Bells.\nMCI Chief Executive Bert Roberts said he was confident the combination with British Telecom would win the approval of federal regulators, noting that \"the U.K. is the most competitive telecommunications market in the world.\"\nHe added that the deal would result in lower expenditures for both companies because \"costs will be reduced by building networks once, not twice.\" The companies expect to save $1.5 billion in costs over five years.\nEmployees, usually tense during mergers, can relax.\n\"Minimal job cuts, that is the joy of this. MCI will operate in the Americas, and BT will operate in the U.K and the rest of the world,\" Vallance told Reuters.\nConcert Plc would be one of the world's largest telecommunications companies, with 43 million business and residential customers in 70 countries.\n\"The complementary strengths and skills of BT and MCI will enable Concert to take full advantage of the great opportunities provided by the forthcoming liberalisation of the telecommunications market in the U.S. and Europe,\" said Vallance.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, which has yet to be approved by regulatory authorities on either side of the Atlantic, MCI shareholders would receive 0.54 new American Depositary Shares in the new combined group for every MCI share. Each Concert ADS is equivalent to one British Telecom American Depositary Share and $6 cash.\nBritish Telecom's ADSs closed at $55.50 in New York on Friday, giving a value of $30 per MCI share, plus $6 in cash per share before the effect of a buyback by British Telecom that is part of the deal, MCI Chief Financial Officer Doug Maine told Reuters.\nBritish Telecom said Concert will buy back up to 10 percent of its shares after the deal closes. The maximum buyback would increase the value of the deal to MCI shareholders to $39.60 per MCI share. MCI's stock closed Friday at $30.25 on Nasdaq.\nThe new company, incorporated in Britain, would have headquarters in London and Washington and operate under the British Telecom and MCI brand names.\nBritish Telecom has been looking for a major acquisition since its proposed merger with British rival Cable and Wireless failed in May. It had been keen to forge that deal because it would have given it access to the lucrative Asian telecoms market -- the world's fastest-growing market.\nAnalysts now expect British Telecom and MCI to start making overtures to major Asian players such as Japan's giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.\nBut while seeking an Asian partner, MCI is putting another one on a backburner.\nMCI is to cut its stake in a U.S. satellite venture with Australian media tycoon Rupert Murdoch to 20 percent from 50 percent, and will not increase its stake in Murdoch's News Corp as originally expected.\n\"It is unlikely you will see us increasing our investment (in News Corp),\" Roberts told Reuters.\nMCI paid $1.35 billion for a stake of just under 9 percent, and could increase it to 13 percent with another $1 billion investment.\nRoberts added that if U.S. regulatory permission could be obtained, he may even sell the $700 million license that goes with the U.S. direct-to-home broadcast satellite to Murdoch.",

It is not,\" Lukomnik said.\nGoing forward, Lukomnik said he is looking for ADM to, over time, enact steps to make its board more independent and to set a succession plan for the eventual retirement of Chairman Dwayne Andreas, aged 78.\nThe chairman's son, Vice Chairman Michael Andreas, is among two executives still being investigated by the Justice Department as the price-fixing probe continues. Also being investigated is ADM Group Vice President Terrance Wilson.\n\"Dwayne Andreas is not young. A person they were grooming to be a successor is the target of an investigation,\" Lukomnik said, referring to Michael Andreas, who had been seen in the past as a possible successor to the chairman's post.\nAs previously reported, a shareholder proposal calling for a more independent board at ADM is garnering a significant number of votes.\nThe California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) said earlier a survey of votes cast thus far indicated that 47 percent are in favour of that measure.\nCalPERS co-sponsored the proposal with the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund.\n\"Our primary focus is the proposal,\" Brad Pacheco, a spokesman for CalPERS said. \"But i think we also need to see some increased oversight (of management by the board).\"\nOther proposals include a measure by the carpenters to hold directors personally liable for gross negligence. The New York City Fire Department Pension Fund proposed that shareholders' votes for directors remain confidential when there is no competing proxy.\nAt last year's annual meeting, Chairman Dwayne Andreas kept a lid on shareholder comments. When Durkin of the carpenters union tried to gain the floor, he was told by the chairman, \"This meeting runs according to my rules.\"\nDurkin, who will attend this year's annual meeting, said he was hopeful shareholders would be able to voice their concerns this year.\nHe added the company had sent him a fax outlining the agenda, when issues will be raised and how much time will be allotted for comments. \"There needs to be some basic rights allowed to the (share) owners,\" Durkin said.\nThe Justice Department said its price-fixing investigation continues. ADM has agreed to cooperate with probes involving citric acid as well as high fructose corn syrup.\nHoffman-La Roche Inc, the Nutley, N.J. unit of Roche Holding Ltd of Switzerland, said it has been cooperating with the Justice investigation of citric acid, which is used in food, beverages and other products.\nA.E.

Tulsa-based Oneok is the parent of Oklahoma Natural Gas Co.\nWestern Resources, based in Topeka, Kan., will become the largest equity holder in Oneok, receiving about 3 million new shares of Oneok common stock and preferred stock that will be convertible, upon necessary regulatory approvals, into about another 19.3 million shares of Oneok common. Its total stake in Oneok is about 45 percent.\nThe deal is expected to close by mid-1997, following approval by Oneok shareholders and federal and state regulatory authorities.\n\"They (Oneok) are a total gas company. They understand the gas business better than we do,\" Western Resources president David Wittig said in a telephone interview.\nBy swapping its gas assets, Western Resources will be able to focus its efforts on growing its electricity and home-security businesses, both of which involve a customer base of home owners and 24-hour monitoring of consumers.\nOneok's 735,000 customers could become potential clients of Western Resources' services.\n\"Western Rseources has been becoming a nationwide marketer of retail energy -- electricity and/or gas -- and home security,\" Everen Securities analyst Dan Rudakas said. \"This combination gives them direct access to another 735,000 gas customers, which in the future ... would be potential electric customers and also electronic home security customers.\"\nThe companies said the alliance will position the companies to take advantage of the expected deregulation of the electricity industry, allowing customers to buy electrical power from several sources instead of just the local utility. That type of deregulation is already taking place in the natural gas industry.\n\"Eventuallly there will be total competition in electricity and in gas,\" John Hayes Jr, Western Resources chairman, told a teleconference. \"We are just preparing for the future.\"\nThe companies said Oneok's independence would be preserved by standstill provisions in the agreement that define the rights and responsibilities of the respective companies for at least the next 15 years.\nWestern Resources will receive a preferred dividend of 1.5 times the underlying common dividend, which now stands at 30 cents a share, but no less than $1.80 per preferred share per year for the first five years.\nGeorge K. Baum analyst Dennis Hudson said Western Resources' natural gas assets earned that company about $20 million in 1995. As part of Oneok, the assets likely will earn more, given that company's expertise in gas distributions and synergies from its existing gas business.\nWith its stake in Oneok, Western Resources will still benefit from a portion of the gas earnings, as well as future gas alliances that Oneok might enter into in the future.\n\"Oneok would continue to search for opportunities to acquire more customers on the gas side. We're most supportive of that,\" Wittig said.\nHe added that Western Resources continues to look for ways to expand its electricity and home-security businesses.",

The latest's quarter's results, however, included a $133.6 million pretax gain on the sale of its frozen foods business and $23 million in pretax restructuring charges.\nExcluding these factors, Quaker's third quarter net income was 53 cents a share, which was well above Wall Street estimates of 46 cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks analysts' estimates.\nChairman William William Smithburg said Snapple was expected to report an operating loss for 1996.\n\"Clearly, the biggest challenge facing the company is Snapple's disappointing performance,\" Smithburg said. \"The integrated sampling and advertising campaign that ended in mid-September generated some excitement behind the brand this summer, but we're still disappointed.\"\nWhile he declined to give a specific projection, he said the 1996 operating loss for Snapple likely will be narrower than the loss it reported in 1995, although the business will not generate a profit.\nExcluding goodwill and other charges, Snapple's loss for 1995 was about $6 million, according to analysts' estimates.\nSmithburg said Quaker executives believe Snapple can show a cash profit, which is the goal for next year. He added that results for Snapple could improve next year, even if sales volume were flat.\nQuaker said several alternatives were being considered for Snapple. Those options include making Snapple into a regional brand or perhaps selling the beverage operations.\nThe company said its overall third-quarter sales slipped to $1.44 billion from last year's $1.55 billion, which included $72.3 million in sales from divested businesses.\nTotal beverage sales fell 11 percent to $593.4 million, while beverage operating income dropped 43 percent to $34.0 million. In the United States and Canada, beverage income was $57.5 million, excluding a $16.6 million restructuring charge, down 15 percent from last year.\nQuaker said Gatorade sports drink, the company's single best-selling brand, had a 20 percent rise in operating profit in North America.\nDespite an unseasonably cool summer, which hurt sales of the drink, Gatorade is having another good year, Smithburg said in a teleconference.\nU.S. sales of Gatorade will hit about $1 billion by the end of October, compared with sales of just over $1 billion for all 1995. That is \"kind of an important milestone for us,\" Smithburg said.\nQuaker said U.S. and Canadian foods' operating income of $92.6 million, excluding a $6.4 million restructuring charge, was up 7 percent from last year. These profits rose in spite of price decreases in ready-to-eat cereals.\nSmithburg said Quaker's ready-to-eat cereals, such as Life and Cap'n Crunch, had a 14 percent rise in volume in the third quarter. Value-priced bagged cereals, which carry the Quaker name, are growing at more than 20 pecent.\nThe company said North American foods sales increased 2 percent to $687.3 million. International foods sales rose 9 percent to $152.9 million, with increases in Latin America, Europe and the Pacific. International foods operating income was $2.8 million, down from $3.7 million.",

McDonald's does not disclose same store data measuring sales from units open at least a year.\n\"Margins have been under pressure for over a year in the U.S.,\" added Schroder Wertheim analyst Wayne Daniels.\nNaming Jack Greenberg, who remains vice chairman of the company, as chairman of McDonald's U.S.A. indicates the fast-food giant is not pleased with the direction of its domestic business, Daniels said.  \n\"They are trying to shake things up and put a little more focus on being aggressive in responding to the competition,\" Daniels added.\nAs part of the management changes, Edward Rensi, McDonald's U.S.A president, will report to Greenberg.\n\"Ed and I are good friends. We work well together. He's very enthusiastic about this,\" Greenberg said in a telephone interview. \"We all want this business to do well.\"\nDespite the pressure in the United States, McDonald's international business, which accounts for more than half of its operating income, continues to be strong, analysts said.  \n\"International is a wide-open growth opportunity for McDonald's,\" Daniels said.\nGiven the intense competition between McDonald's, Wendy's International Inc and Grand Metropolitan plc's Burger King, Greenberg faces a tough job as head of the U.S. operations, analysts said.\n\"He is going to parachute into...what looks to be one of the most challenging operating roles in the U.S. fast-food restaurant business,\" Brundage said.\nBut Greenberg, 54, said he believes McDonald's is well positioned to compete in the U.S. market. \"We've got more locations than anybody else.

ADM's slate of 12 directors was approved by about 89 percent of the votes cast, the company announced.\nThe new board, which was reduced in number from 17, was hailed by ADM as a more independent body since Andreas is the only company executive remaining on the board.\nWilliam Bell of the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund said he hoped the 42 percent of the votes cast in favour of the outside director measure would send a signal to ADM about shareholder concerns regarding the independence of the board.\n\"I think it's a positive number,\" Bell told reporters after the meeting. The Florida trust fund and the California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers) co-sponsored the independent board proposal.\nIn a statement released following the meeting, Charles Valdes, chairman of the Calpers, said \"Calpers will continue to meet with directors and pursue the wishes of shareholders that want a majority of indpependent directors and increased oversight of the ADM board.\"\nDuring the meeting, no mention was made of a pending U.S. Department of Justice investigation of Michael Andreas, vice chairman and son of Dwayne Andreas, and Terrance Wilson, a group vice president in charge of corn refining.\nThese two executives are eligible for stock options under an incentive plan that was approved by stockholders Thursday, the company said in response to a question.\nThe antitrust investigation sparked criticism from some large shareholders who questioned the independence of ADM's board of directors and its ability to oversee management.\nOne of the few direct mentions of the antitrust investigation came in response to a question from Ed Durkin of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, an institutional shareholder.\nDurkin asked why ADM had not notified shareholders officially of its guilty pleas to two counts of price fixing and the $100 million plea. Richard Reising, corporate secretary and general counsel, said the company did not consider it necessary given the amount of publicity the antitrust settlement received.\nADM board member Brian Mulroney, former Prime Minister of Canada, told shareholders the \"consensual resolution\" with the Justice Department was reached after negotiations with the board's special committee of independent directors.\n\"This has been a terribly unfortunate experience for the company and we as a committee deeply deplore it,\" Mulroney said.\n\"It is our intention to ensure that the company learns from mistakes in the past and acts so that they never happen again,\" Mulroney said.\nHe referred to the investigation of ADM as a \"shadow\" that was cast on the future of the company.\n\"While some matters still await resolution, I am pleased to tell you today that we have begun to cast off that shadow and move the company forward into the future...,\" Mulroney said.",

The shares later traded at $42, up $1.375.\nAnalysts said Monsanto's life science businesses -- including agricultural chemicals, biotechnology, food additives and pharmaceuticals -- likely would have a higher valuation as a separate company than if Monsanto remained intact.\n\"The key here is that the chemical business does not have the growth potential as the ag-biotech and the ag-chemical and the drug component could,\" NatWest Securities analyst Mark Wiltamuth said.\nMonsanto Chief Economist Nicholas Filippello said in a telephone interview that no options for the chemical operations had been ruled out.\nHe added that a decision was expected to be made as soon as possible, but did not give a timeframe. \"As soon as practical,\" he said.\nMonsanto had been expected to shed its chemical businesses, which are affected by economic cycles and the price of commodity raw materials, since the sale late last year of its worldwide styrenics plastics business.\nIn recent months, it has been the strength of Monsanto's agricultural business that has propelled the stock upward.\nSpinning off the chemical businesses as a separate company was the option that most analysts favoured, since it would not have the tax implication of an outright sale.\n\"I would say the chances of keeping it (chemicals) and restructuring it are pretty slim,\" Dain Bosworth analyst Bonnie Wittenburg said.\nThe chemical businesses that may be sold or spun off include nylon and acrylic fibers, Saflex plastic interlayer, which is sold to glass manufacturers, and speciality chemicals.\n\"The chemical operations ... would be very viable as a standalone company,\" said NatWest analyst Andrew Cash.\nCash said Monsanto's acrylic fiber, nylon and Saflex businesses have limited competition in the United States and very favourable cost structures.\n\"It would be a focused company with good technology ... and a lot of interest in the assets from a stock market perspective, if they choose to spin it off,\" Cash said.\nHowever, agricultural chemicals would remain as one of the crown jewels of the life sciences division.\nMonsanto's popular Roundup weed killer is key to Monsanto's agricultural biotechnology business. The company has developed crops that are genetically altered to resist Roundup.\nThe life science operations also would include food additives and Monsanto's G.D. Searle pharmaceutical division. In a recent report, NatWest said it expected Monsanto to keep Searle, which some analysts previously thought would be sold.\nIn 1995 Monsanto's chemical sales of $3.69 billion accounted for about 40 percent of the company's total sales of $8.96 billion. The chemical businesses' operating profit of $357 million was 30 percent of the total profit of $1.17 billion.\nIn contrast, agricultural profit of $523 million accounted for nearly 45 percent of the total.",

On a per share basis, Kellogg's earnings dropped 29 percent to 75 cents, with fewer shares outstanding, from $1.05 last year.\nKellogg said its overall sales slipped 9 percent to $1.68 billion from $1.84 billion as continued weak prices for breakfast cereals offset a 1 percent gain in worldwide sales volume.\n\"As previously forecast, our third quarter performance was influenced significantly by competitive conditions in the U.S. cereal category,\" Kellogg Chairman Arnold Langbo said in a statement.\nAnalysts estimate that Kellogg's domestic cereal sales volume fell 9 percent to 10 percent in the third quarter.\n\"We can't detail it. It was a challenging quarter in the U.S. and our volume was down,\" Lovell added.\nKellogg said its fourth quarter 1996 earnings likely will show a slight rise from the 77 cents it earned a year ago. First quarter 1997 earnings, however, may not match the 99 cents earned in the 1996 period.\n\"It's a challenging comparison,\" Lovell said.\nKellogg's stock fell on concern over U.S. cereal sales volume and the outlook for earnings, dropping $1 at $64.50 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier, it set a new 52-week low of $64.125.\nKellogg said the U.S. cereal market overall was sluggish, with sales growing about 1.5 percent, measuring grocery stores, mass merchandisers and all other outlets.\nLooking ahead, Kellogg refused to outline what promotional programmes it was planning for the fourth quarter.\nAnalysts said they did not expect the Battle Creek, Mich.-based cereal giant to return to deep-discount coupons or buy-one, get-one-free promotional giveaways.\n\"It's sort of left to speculation what they're going to do,\" SBC Warburg analyst Chris Jakubik said.\n\"There is no indication that, at this time, they have shifted from their long-term strategic goal, which is to reduce inefficient promotions,\" added BT Securities analyst John O'Neil.\nKellogg reduced prices on about two-thirds of its breakfast cereals in June. Other major manufacturers also cut prices this year as they battled for market share and tried to jump-start consumer purchases.\nBut those price cuts alone apparently were not enough to jump-start consumer purchases, according to Smith Barney analyst David Rabinowitz.\n\"The message there is that prices have to come down further,\" Rabinowitz said.\nAccording to Information Resources data, U.S. ready-to-eat cereal sales in grocery stores fell 1.6 percent to 2.6 billion pounds for the 52 weeks ended Aug. 11, according to the most recent data available, compared with a year earlier.\nKellogg's sales volume declined in that period by 4.1 percent to 881.3 million pounds for a market share of about 34.4 percent, Information Resources said.",

Earnings per share gained 11 percent, with fewer shares outstanding, to 62 cents a share from 56 cents.\nEarnings for the quarter, however, were about 1 cent below what analysts had expected.\nMcDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Ill., said operating earnings in the United States fell five percent in the third quarter while company revenues rose only one percent.\n\"Our U.S. restaurants are operating in a complex, dynamic and difficult marketplace and recent operating performance has fallen short of our goals,\" Chairman Michael Quinlan said in a statement.\nMcDonald's said U.S. same store sales -- measuring results for units open at least one year -- were negative for both the third quarter and nine-month period.\nBut U.S. sales may be picking up, said Merrill Lynch analyst Peter Oakes. \"I think (U.S. same store sales) are starting to hit bottom,\" Oakes said. \"Thus far in October, it (seems) like they have picked up and are in the flattish range.\"\nMcDonald's recently reorganized its management to address disappointing results in the United States.\nOutside the United States, McDonald's operating earnings grew 11 percent in the quarter as revenue jumped 13 percent.\nIt said growth in earnings was strongest in Hong Kong, England, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Taiwan.

Those charges may include write-offs of Holden's in-process research and development, which would reduce the amount of ongoing amortization from the deal.\nBased on Monsanto's benchmark of measuring itself on an \"economic value added\" (EVA) basis, the acquisition is positive for the company, Filippello added.\n\"We are willing to accept some near-term dilution in (earnings per share) from an accounting standpoint if in fact we are creating value in a net added value sense,\" he said.  \nEVA is derived by taking net income and subtracting a charge for the capital used to generate that income, Monsanto said in its 1995 annual report.\nEarlier, Monsanto said it will buy Holden's,  Corn States Hybrid Service Inc and  Corn States International for up to $1.02 billion.\nFilippello said Monsanto will pay up to $945.0 million for Holden's, which produces corn germplasm used by seed companies to create hybrid seeds. It will pay up to $75 million for Corn States and Corn States International, which are the exclusive worldwide marketing and sales representatives for Holden's.  \nBoth prices may later be reduced, Filippello added.\nAnalysts said Monsanto's acquisition of Holden's, which had been expected, is also a defensive move to block its competitors from gaining access to the seed company.\nNatWest Securities analyst Mark Wiltamuth said he considers the planned acquisition of Holden's and Corn States \"a strategic positive\".\nBy buying Holden's, Monsanto gains an outlet for its genetic developments. Simply put, Monsanto can implant the genes it develops in the germplasm -- or parent seeds -- produced by Holden's.\nMonsanto said more than 35 percent of the approximately 80 million acres of corn planted in the United Sates use genetic material developed by Holden's.\nFilippello said the Corn States International acquisition also gives Monsanto access to some 300 million acres of corn worldwide.\nThe other positive for Monsanto is the ability to sell more of its flagship Roundup herbicide to farmers who plant genetically-enhanced seeds from Holden's. Monsanto has developed a gene that makes crops, like corn, resistant to use of its Roundup herbicide to kill weeds in the field.",

Shares were down $0.25 at $52.625 a share on Monday, $4.125 below a 52-week high of $56.75 but more than $10 above a low of $42.125.\nIn fact, losing out on the potential $2.2 billion in jet fighter contracts -- which could eventually be worth as much as $500 billion to the ultimate winner -- could prompt McDonnell Douglas to pursue an acquisition aggressively to build its defense business, analysts added.  \nCS First Boston analyst Peter Aseritis said he expected the company's \"board and management to take a fairly proactive stance...to do something in the merger and acquisition area.\"\nAnalysts also shrugged off Boeing getting the plane order from AMR's American Airlines, saying McDonnell Douglas was not a serious contender after it cancelled development of its next generation commercial plane, known as the MD-XX.\n\"They were never in the running,\" Merrill Lynch analyst Byron Callan said of McDonnell Douglas.  \n\"The events don't affect near-term earnings in either case,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Howard Rubel said of the lost jet fighter and American Airlines deals.\nMcDonnell Douglas management said the Pentagon business would have been a significant long-term program for it.  But analysts said the company still has a chance to capture future military sales, particularly with acquisitions to build its portfolio, which now includes the F-18 fighter jet, C-17 military cargo plane and Apache helicopter.  \n\"The things to keep in mind are, the joint strike fighter is a long ways away.

ADM previously settled civil cases brought by its customers and agreed to pay $25 million in the lysine case and $35 million to buyers of its citric acid.\nA civil case brought by high-fructose corn syrup customers is pending.\n\"The important news here is just that the criminal investigation is behind them,\" said Bonnie Wittenburg, an analyst at Dain Bosworth, a Minneapolis-based brokerage.\nInvestors reacted positively to the settlement and sent ADM shares up 75 cents to $21.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, a 52-week high.\nThe federal probe of alleged price-fixing in the food and feed additive markets was first disclosed by ADM in June 1995. At that time, ADM said it was subpoenaed for documents and testimony as part of a probe of the lysine, citric acid and high-fructose corn syrup markets.\nA former ADM executive, Mark Whitacre, acted as a government informant for about three years in the investigation. Whitacre, who was president of ADM's BioProducts Division, was fired in August 1995 when the company accused him of stealing $9.5 million.\nWhitacre has denied those charges and has said he plans to file a wrongful dismissal lawsuit against ADM.\nADM said the plea agreement resulted from negotiations between Justice Department officials and a special committee of seven independent board members.\nADM said the special committee was created in 1995 to respond to the department's investigation into ADM's alleged anti-competitive activity and related civil litigation.\nAnalysts also said the fate of Michael Andreas was not expected to impact the succession at ADM. \"That issue was settled a long time ago. Mick is not a successor,\" said George Dahlman at Piper Jaffray, a Minneapolis-based brokerage, referring to Michael Andreas.\nIn an interview in January, Dwayne Andreas said he believed there were eight people who might succeed him some day, including his son. But he said at the time there was no succession plan at the company. ADM's proxy statement lists Dwayne Andreas' age at 78.",

It is not,\" Lukomnik said.\nGoing forward, Lukomnik said he is looking for ADM to, over time, enact steps to make its board more independent and to set a succession plan for the eventual retirement of Chairman Dwayne Andreas, aged 78.  \nThe chairman's son, Vice Chairman Michael Andreas, is among two executives still being investigated by the Justice Department as the price-fixing probe continues. Also being investigated is ADM Group Vice President Terrance Wilson.\n\"Dwayne Andreas is not young. A person they were grooming to be a successor is the target of an investigation,\" Lukomnik said, referring to Michael Andreas, who had been seen in the past as a possible successor to the chairman's post.\nA shareholder proposal calling for a more independent board at ADM is garnering a significant number of votes.  \nThe California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) said earlier a survey of votes cast thus far indicated that 47 percent are in favor of that measure.\nCalPERS co-sponsored the proposal with the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund.\n\"Our primary focus is the proposal,\" Brad Pacheco, a spokesman for CalPERS, said. \"But i think we also need to see some increased oversight (of management by the board).\"\nOther proposals include a measure by the carpenters to hold directors personally liable for gross negligence. The New York City Fire Department Pension Fund proposed confidential voting for directors when there is no competing proxy.\nAt last year's annual meeting, Chairman Dwayne Andreas kept a lid on shareholder comments. When Durkin of the carpenters union tried to gain the floor, he was told by the chairman, \"This meeting runs according to my rules.\"\nDurkin, who will attend this year's annual meeting, said he was hopeful shareholders would be able to voice their concerns this year.\nHe added the company had sent him a fax outlining the agenda, when issues will be raised and how much time will be allotted for comments. \"There needs to be some basic rights allowed to the (share) owners,\" Durkin said.",

Pioneer debt notes would also become convertible into Conseco stock.\nPioneer Financial jumped $5.50 to $24.50 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Conseco stock was up 50 cents at $60 in consolidated trading.\nThe transaction is subject to approval by regulators and Pioneer Financial stockholders. It should be completed within 180 days, the companies said.\nFor Pioneer, a health and life insurance and annuities company based in Schaumburg, Ill., its agreement to join forces with Conseco reflects continued consolidation in the industry. Pioneer markets mainly to people 65 and older, small business owners and the self-employed.\n\"With the consolidation that's going on in the industry, you're going to have to be a mega-company to have the greatest efficiency and the greatest value to the customer,\" Everen analyst Frederick Sandburg said.\nThat consolidation is apparent in Conseco's track record of completing 16 acquisitions involving a total of 29 insurance companies since 1982.\nConseco is one of the nation's leading providers of supplemental health insurance, retirement annuities and universal life insurance.\nRosensteele said while acquisitions continued to be a part of Conseco's strategy, roughly half of the growth of its assets has been from new business generated by companies after they have been purchased.\nConseco said it would have $29 billion of assets and $32 billion of investments under management after completion of the Pioneer acquisition and other deals.\nBeyond the portfolio of policies, the Pioneer acquisition also will add to Conseco's marketing efforts, particularly to senior citizens, analysts said. Pioneer has 90,000 agents, in addition to Conseco's 90,000 independent and career agents.\nFounded in 1979, fast-growing Conseco has completed several acquisitions recently. In October, it completed the purchase of American Life Holdings Inc., a provider of annuities for retirement savings plans, for $165 million in cash.\nOn Aug. 26, Conseco agreed to acquire American Travellers Corp., a provider of long-term care insurance, for $793 million in stock, and Capitol American Financial Corp., which markets cancer insurance and other health coverage, for $650 million in cash and stock.\nAlso in August, Conseco completed the acquisition of Life Partners Group, a life insurer, for $600 million in stock, a deal that was announced on March 12.",

But in spite of a new menu, its U.S. same-store sales are below year-ago levels.\n\"This will be their sixth consecutive quarter of lower comps (same store sales) in the U.S.,\" Dean Witter analyst David Adelman said, referring to the fourth quarter of 1996.\nWendy's International Inc, on the other hand, has seen U.S. same store sales rise five to six percent in the fourth quarter, following an eight percent gain in the third quarter. Spokesman Denny Lynch declined to comment.\n\"Wendy's..., although their margins have been squeezed, has the best traffic of the big three,\" said Roger Lipton of Lipton Financial Services.\nWendy's has about 4,425 U.S. units and 4,925 worldwide.\nBurger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan Plc, said its U.S. same-store sales rose 2.6 percent for fiscal 1996 ended September 30.\nBurger King had 8,696 units worldwide at the end of fiscal 1996, including more than 6,600 in the United States.\nAt this point, Wendy's may have the most significant new product offering in 1997, a fresh pita sandwich that is currently being tested in 11 U.S. markets and may be rolled out nationally next year, analysts said.\n\"It's being given very serious consideration,\" Lynch said of pita sandwiches. \"We're very pleased with the test.\"\nAdelman said he expects the pita sandwich to be launched in the United States later in 1997, adding, \"That's going to be a material event for (Wendy's).\"\nIn 1996, McDonald's stole the menu spotlight by introducing its Arch Deluxe hamburger, garnished with lettuce, tomato and a mustard-mayonnaise sauce, as well new chicken and fish deluxe sandwiches.\nIn spite of those new menu items, McDonald's same store sales continued to show declines compared with a year ago.\nMcDonald's U.S. same store sales showed a negative comparison in the first nine months of 1996, spokesman Chuck Ebeling said, but he declined comment on the fourth quarter.\nMcDonald's has blamed the drop in its U.S. same store sales in part on an intensely competitive domestic market.\nLooking ahead, analysts said the most significant event for McDonald's likely will be the start in 1997 of its 10-year exclusive marketing alliance with Walt Disney Co. That alliance gives McDonald's exclusive rights to marketing tie-ins -- such as toy giveaways -- to Disney movies.\nEbeling said the Disney alliance will be the \"centerpiece\" of McDonald's marketing efforts, \"but not the only thing.\"\nAs for its menu, Ebeling said McDonald's will continue to focus on \"delivering great food taste,\" but he did not comment on new items.",

Quaker has consistently declined to comment on any speculation.\n\"I will simply tell you that it is our policy not to comment on rumors and speculation,\" Quaker spokesman Ronald Bottrell said Friday.\nThe speculation gained credibility, analysts said, when the Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Quaker might sell Gatorade and Snapple, with prices quoted between $3 billion and $4 billion.\n\"I would have said (the chance of Quaker selling its beverage business was) less than 50-50 before I read the article,\" BT Securities analyst John O'Neil said. \"But I think if somebody offers them $4 billion ... they have to take it.\"\nThe Wall Street Journal said the most likely buyers for Quaker's beverage business were said to be Procter & Gamble Co. and PepsiCo Inc..\nPepsiCo also declined to comment.\n\"We have a long standing policy of not commenting on rumors,\" said Richard Detwiler, director of public relations for PepsiCo.\nIf Quaker sold its beverage businesses, its food businesses, including oatmeal, ready-to-eat cereal and pasta and rice dishes, could also attract buyers, analysts said.\nThe Wall Street Journal said Philip Morris Cos. Inc. might be interested in buying some of Quaker's food brands to bolster its Kraft Foods operation.\nA Kraft spokesman did not return a call seeking comment.\nIt had been widely anticipated that Quaker would scale back Snapple to a regional brand, spin it off or sell it.\nQuaker management, however, said earlier this year that Snapple's fruit-flavored and iced tea beverage business would remain a national brand.\n\"What he (Chairman William Smithburg) has been saying does not indicate that he is looking to sell the business right now,\" O'Neil of BT Securities said. \"But he always comments that he will act to increase shareholder value.\"\nSmith Barney analyst David Rabinowitz said selling off Quaker's businesses may yield the highest return to shareholders on a short-term basis. But \"it doesn't have to happen,\" Rabinowitz said.\nAnalysts have said previously that they expected Quaker to write off additional goodwill for Snapple, which would be a non-cash charge.\nThe company said in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it will review Snapple for a possible charge to reduce its carrying value.",

His nearest rival, Ti Liang Yang, would get 27.9 percent of popular support.\nSovereignty over the territory of 6.3 million people, one of Asia's economic wonders and Britain's last major colony, reverts to China at midnight next June 30 -- 203 days from now.\nThe winner of Wednesday's vote by the committee will become the chief executive-designate of the Special Administrative Region of China, as Hong Kong will be called from next July 1.\nOn the eve of the vote a small band of pro-democracy protesters camped overnight outside the conference centre.\nSome politicians and diplomats fretted about China-style repression. \"The people of Hong Kong cannot trust him (Tung) to protect our rights...I cannot see how he is in a position to say no to Beijing on any important issue,\" said legislator Martin Lee.\n\"Unless there is a complete change in the attitude of these candidates the outlook for human rights in Hong Kong is very bad,\" said Paul Harris, head of Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor.\nBut the markets, a barometer of Hong Kong's fortunes, trumpeted bullish optimism. Hong Kong stocks rebounded from recent losses to end 198 points up, the index of China-linked H-shares soared to nine-month highs in the largest one-day gain in history, and forecasters predicted a 1997 property boom.\nPublicly espousing \"consensus\" rather than confrontation with China, and collective duties over individual rights, and blessed by a public handshake from President Jiang Zemin in January, 59-year-old Shanghai-born Tung grabbed 206 votes in the first round of voting last month by the committee.\nHe only needs 201 to win the clincher on Wednesday. Some Hong Kong newspapers were already putting the finishing touches on Tuesday to a slew of Tung-the-victor profiles for Wednesday.\nIf he wins, he will be greeted by a no-confidence debate presented by lawmaker Emily Lau, one of China's loudest critics, in Hong Kong's Legislative Council (Legco).\nGovernor Chris Patten has vowed support for the future leader, whoever he is, in the twilight of British rule.\nBut Tung has not responded to the plege. He has said he will consult Hong Kong's respected civil service on how best to run the territory and ensure a smooth transition.\n\"Nobody wants the present administration to be turned into a lame duck,\" Tung said on Monday.\nIf he wins, Tung will spend the next six months assembling a cabinet of advisers to guide policy. His team is expected to be highly pro-business.\nHe will also lay the groundwork for a provisional legislature, soon to be picked by the same Selection Committee, to take over from the present elected Legco next July 1.",

Liu Gang fled last May after months of police harassment following a six-year prison stint for helping to lead the 1989 student protest movement.\n\"According to our information Wang is safe at the moment,\" Robin Munro, Director of Human Rights Watch Asia, told Reuters.\n\"I think it's likely he'll probably be going on somewhere else fairly soon,\" Munro said.\nMunro said he was unable to say where Wang was heading, but other human rights sources in Hong Kong said he was seeking refuge in the United States.\nWashington has been generous in granting asylum to Beijing's political critics since a military crackdown against the student-led democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in June 1989.\nScores, perhaps hundreds, of Chinese dissenters have fled to the West since then through Hong Kong, local activists say.\n\"I assume he was about to be arrested by the Chinese authorities. I can't think what else would have prompted such a rapid departure,\" Munro said, attributing Wang's move to the three-year sentence passed on dissident Liu Xiaobo last week.\nWang and Liu sparked reprisals against remaining dissidents last month when they wrote a letter demanding the impeachment of President Jiang Zemin for violating the constitution by placing the army under Communist Party, rather than state, control.\nHuman rights sources said it was unlikely Wang would speak publicly in Hong Kong but that he would explain himself when he reached his destination.\nAs Hong Kong prepares to revert to Chinese sovereignty next July 1, issues of human rights, and especially help for mainland dissidents, have become acutely sensitive.\n\"The Hong Kong government asks such people to keep quiet while they are here as the price for facilitating their smooth exit from the territory,\" one human rights source said. \"And the Americans go along with that quiet, too,\" he said.\nMunro saw the latest developments in China as a blow.\n\"It's extremely discouraging and quite deplorable the way the (Chinese) government has intensified its crackdown on the few remaining dissidents in China in recent weeks,\" said Munro.\nHe said the dissident movement in China had effectively been crushed, with all prominent dissidents either in jail or forced into exile.\n\"The saddest thing about it is that Wang appears to have concluded there's no way he could continue to struggle for change from within the country,\" Munro said.\nWang's activism dates from 1974 when he co-authored an attack in Guangdong on the radical 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.\nHe took part in the 1979 Democracy Wall movement in Beijing and produced his own dissident newsletters. He was twice imprisoned and spent some 17 years in jail and labour camps.\nHe was released on parole in 1993, and before he fled he had been under constant police surveillance.",

He fielded his questions skillfully, shifting effortlessly between three languages -- Mandarin, Cantonese and English.\nTung quipped and charmed with great self-confidence and a charismatic style that would be the envy of many Chinese leaders in Beijing, not known for their skillful handling of the media.\nHe declared he would go on the offensive to persuade Hong Kong's 6.3 million people to trust a controversial 60-member provisional legislature which China plans to install in place of the present elected Legislative Council (Legco) when Britain hands back the colony to Beijing next July 1.\n\"I think you'll find the provisional legislature will have good credibility,\" the businessman turned politician said.\n\"The acceptability of the provisional legislature is gaining ground every day. I'm confident we'll find 60 people with credibility among the people of Hong Kong.\"\nThursday's Preparatory Committee meeting in the boomtown of Shenzhen was working on a package of procedures for selecting the legislature on December 21, the next milestone in Hong Kong's march to Chinese rule.\nHong Kong's Democratic Party has condemned the move as an attempt to snuff out the territory's embryonic democracy and vowed to challenge the legislature's legality in the courts, forcing China to consider locating the body on the mainland rather than in Hong Kong.\nBut Tung said he would also like to charm the Democrats by sitting down with them and \"peacefully\" discussing the transition problems.\nTung said he hoped to cooperate with departing governor Chris Patten and the British colonial administration. He recognised there were many difficulties but said: \"Let's do what is best for Hong Kong.\"\nHe also said that Hong Kong would continue its gradual shift towards greater democracy but only at the slower pace laid down in the territory's post-1997 constitution, the Basic Law.\n\"We will of course move forward on the course of democracy in accordance with the Basic Law,\" he said. \"The process has already begun. It's quite clearly defined in the Basic Law.\"\nTung said he had no news yet on who he planned to bring into his kitchen cabinet, the Executive Council, or whether Hong Kong's current chief civil servant Anson Chan would stay on.\n\"I hope she will stay, I hope she will be my deputy,\" he said, repeating his desire for a through-train civil service and smooth transition.\nTung also said he would go to Beijing for investiture as the Chief Executive-designate of Hong Kong but no date had been set.",

        "Text": "A former top judge who is vying to lead Hong Kong after China takes over next year has said the territory needs a neutral and impartial leader rather than a well-connected tycoon, and one who is tolerant towards dissent.\n\"I'm for tolerance,\" Yang Ti Liang, one of three candidates trying to become Hong Kong's first chief executive after Britain hands the colony back to China at midnight next June 30, told Reuters in an interview.\nThe 67-year-old Shanghai-born former chief justice, who shed his British knighthood a month ago, came through this month's first round of voting by a 400-strong China-backed Selection Committee with 82 of the votes.\nHe was well behind frontrunner Tung Chee-hwa, a shipping tycoon with strong China links who scored 206 votes, but ahead of another entrepreneur, Peter Woo, who scraped through with 54.\nTung has often been depicted as Beijing's favourite in the race. But Yang, who has emerged as the people's favourite in some recent opinion polls, and once with a lead of as many as 10 percentage points, is battling on, even though there will be no public vote for the top post.\n\"Of course the votes indicated that certainly the Selection Committee favours Tung much more than they favour me. It's an uphill battle. It's not easy. But I think there's still hope,\" Yang said.\nOver the coming week candidates will be quizzed by committee members on their policies ahead of their final vote on December 11.\nAsked if the committee was likely to heed his popularity with the public, Yang said: \"I think to a certain extent it will. I don't think they will follow the poll to the letter. If there's a vast difference shown between candidates in the polls, the committee will have to take note.\"\nYang's campaign headquarters is a modest, cramped office rented in a hotel, in marked contrast the plush executive suites occupied by Tung. The \"campaign\" is a crusade to lobby business and interest groups, not the general public.\nYang described his greatest strength in comparison with Tung as his long experience as a fair, unbiased arbiter.\n\"I have no business connections or political connections ... having been a judge for the past 30 years. I am somebody above politics, above connections, neutral, impartial, as opposed to somebody who is very much in business and whose contact with the Chinese government is very good,\" he said.\n\"I think anybody who has a huge network with other people does give rise to the problem as to whether, if eventually selected, he might not be perceived to be influenced by these connections when making a decision.\"\nYang said Hong Kong's future leader would not face a test of courage in standing up to Beijing's communist rulers to resist pressure for a crackdown on anti-communist dissenters and pro-democracy activists.\n\"It's not a question of being brave or not brave. It's a question of looking at the letter of the law and seeing what it allows,\" he said. \"I want to be on the side of tolerance.\"\nHe said he hoped a law on sedition, treason and subversion required by Beijing would not be enacted by the controversial interim legislature that China plans to install at the handover, but by a new long-term legislature to be elected in 1998.\nYang also said he believed the Chinese Communist Party, which has long operated underground and behind the scenes in Hong Kong, should register as a party under local law if it planned to be active in the territory after 1997.",

        "Text": "Thumbing its nose at Britain, China brought Hong Kong's elected legislature a step closer to oblivion on Saturday when it founded a new lawmaking body to take over next July when it takes back the colony.\nThe birth of the Provisional Legislative Council in the frontier city of Shenzhen brought Hong Kong to a crucial turning point in its journey towards Chinese rule at midnight next June 30 and opened the way for a possible clash in the world court.\nThe body, stuffed with pro-China politicians and tycoons, was attacked by Britain, Washington and local protesters. London challenged China to let the International Court of Justice in The Hague rule on its legality.\nThe legislative body is a big crease in Sino-British relations that could cause instability in the territory in the run-up to the handover, now less than 200 days away.\nThe speaker of Hong Kong's Legislative Council and 32 other incumbent lawmakers were among the 60 members chosen by a 400-member China-controlled Selection Committee.\nCongratulating the 60, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen declared the contest had been \"just, fair, open and based on democratic principles\" and had the approval of a wide spectrum of Hong Kong society.\nDominic Chan, recently expelled from the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's largest, also grabbed a seat. The Democratic Party has boycotted the selection as anti-democratic.\nThe winners included pro-China politicians such as Tsang Yok-sing, Elsie Tu and Peggy Lam, who were routed in 1995 Legco elections when more than a million people went to the polls and voted resoundingly for pro-democracy forces.\nPro-democracy groups staged noisy protests in Hong Kong declaring the Shenzhen meeting a \"fake election\" and a \"black day for democracy\". They launched 50 helium-filled balloons into China with a protest banner attached.\n\"Today we will have two legislatures...This is a constitutional crisis,\" said the Democratic Party's Andrew Cheng, a current legislator.\nBeijing's communist rulers are bent on imposing themselves firmly on Hong Kong and on ending 150 years of national shame over the forced cession of the territory to Britain in 19th century wars over the opium trade.\nGovernor Chris Patten, who has introduced elements of democracy in this territory of 6.3 million people over the past four years, denounced the Shenzhen vote as a \"bizarre farce\".\n\"The reality is that over a million people in Hong Kong voted for the present Legislative Council. And up over the border now, 400 people -- 400 -- are voting for a so-called provisional legislature,\" Patten said on Saturday.\nDorothy Liu Yiu-chu, a Hong Kong member of China's parliament -- the National People's Congress -- and the Selection Committee, dissented and stayed away from the vote.\n\"I am sick. This is the official reason from the point of view of the Selection Committee. But I know, and I don't mind letting the world know, the real reason is that I don't agree to the establishment of the provisional legislature,\" she said.\nEarlier this month she took part in the committee's first task, selecting shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa as Patten's successor.\nTung dismissed Britain's suggestion of world court arbitration on Saturday, saying: \"We cannot have a legal vacuum in 1997. This is a great day for Hong Kong.\"\nChina's official spokesman in Hong Kong, Zhang Junsheng, said Britain's challenge would not undermine the provisional legislature's authority.\n\"Establishing the provisional legislature is an internal affair of China. If Britain demands international arbitration it is absurd and ignorant,\" Zhang told the Mad Dog Daily.\nThe U.S. Consul-General in Hong Kong, Richard Boucher, called the legislature vote \"a backward step\".\n\"We think it's a bad idea and a mistake,\" Boucher said. \"I don't think we would describe it as an open and fair election which is an essential part of Hong Kong's future stability and future business environment.\"\nDemocratic Party leader Martin Lee has vowed to seek a court injunction against the provisional body if it meets in Hong Kong before July 1.\n\"If this sham legislature is lawful, why not appoint it and have it meet in Hong Kong, where the Supreme Court can decide on its legality,\" Lee said on Friday.",

        "Text": "The Hong Kong government was in a flap on Thursday after a bombshell admission that Britain could not protect Hong Kong holders of British passports after China takes over the colony next July.\nGovernor Chris Patten called an urgent meeting of the Legislative Council for later on Thursday to make a statement on the controversy, which arose after a British envoy said London could provide no consular protection for the passport holders.\nPatten's spokesman said the issue had sparked \"considerable public interest and a good deal of misunderstanding\" as well as demands by legislators to meet him.\nPatten would answer their questions at the extraordinary sitting of Legco on Thursday evening.\nThe uproar is the latest jolt in Hong Kong's often bumpy transition back to Chinese rule 208 days from now, when 150 years of colonial rule will end and the territory will become an autonomous region of China.\nBritain's Senior Trade Commissioner, Francis Cornish, said on Tuesday that London could not protect the more than 135,000 Hong Kong people granted full British passports with right of abode in Britain under a special selection scheme in 1990.\nIn a concession to widespread demands for full British citizenship after Beijing's 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, London offered passports to 50,000 Hong Kong households, a privileged fraction of Hong Kong's 6.3 million people.\nCornish said China regarded these people as holders of dual citizenship and would not recognise British consular protection for them on Chinese soil, on the mainland or in Hong Kong.\nCornish's remarks were denounced by local politicians as a sell-out. In the corridors of the Hong Kong government even the most senior officials were privately criticising Britain for what they saw as a concession to China, one source said.\nOn Wednesday, London and the Hong Kong government rushed to assure affected passport holders that anyone claiming sole British nationality would receive consular protection until it was proven they held dual citizenship.\nBut a British statement made clear Britain could not give full consular protection for people holding dual Chinese nationality once Hong Kong becomes part of China again.\nBritish officials said the passports issued to these people were indistinguishable from any other full British passport, but many in Hong Kong are concerned that Britain may have learned that China had obtained the names of the passport hodlers.\n\"The only way to know for sure if one of these passports was issued under the special scheme would be if you had the names,\" a senior government source said.\nThe transition to Chinese rule has been dogged by disputes since the 1989 Beijing crackdown. China reacted furiously to the special passport scheme, and again when Patten introduced reforms expanding democracy in 1992.\nChina was infuriated last week when Britain unveiled a liberal anti-subversion bill that would set legal markers against China-style jailings of dissidents in Hong Kong.\nBritish and Chinese senior negotiators are in the midst of a three-day bargaining session on handover details and have signalled they expect to announce accords on several issues on Friday, although the agenda has so far remained confidential.\nHong Kong is supposed to be autonomous and keep its capitalist system intact for another 50 years, but a human rights group said on Wednesday China's crackdown on dissent bode badly for the territory and its autonomy prospects were slim.\n\"The rule of law and human rights picture is bleak,\" said Human Rights Monitor director Law Yuk-kai on the launch of an annual human rights report.",

The China-controlled Selection Committee is in the midst of a three-day vetting of Tung and two rivals who are bidding to succeed colonial Governor Chris Patten.\nThe winner will be announced on December 11.\nOn Tuesday, Britain began the process of bringing in a law on subversion, laying down legal markers defining the concepts of treason, sedition, subversion and secession in a bid to head off Chinese-style jailings of dissidents after the handover.\nChina has condemned the move but stopped short of saying whether the law would be scrapped when it takes over the territory.\nTung, a billionaire shipping tycoon, also told the committee that Hong Kong should stand by China if Beijing is under sanction by foreign powers.\n\"If sanction is for political reasons then we have to consider Hong Kong's position. Maybe Hong Kong has to make some sacrifices,\" he said.\nAn opinion poll released on Thursday showed Tung to be the favourite among the 967 respondents and indicated 73 percent of them also believed Tung was the candidate best able to communicate with the Chinese government.\nThe poll, conducted by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, showed that only 7.2 percent thought former chief justice Ti Liang Yang could commmunicate well with Beijing while businessman Peter Woo scored only two percent.\nBut Yang was seen as being the most impartial of the three and the one most ready to voice his opinion to China.\nAsked who was most likely to speak out against Beijing, 31 percent said Yang, 20 percent Tung and 4.8 percent Woo.\nAfter the first day of questioning by the committee on Wednesday, Tung emerged as a better communicator than he had during previous occasions, analysts said.\nThey said he produced a clearly focused vision for Hong Kong, with the main thrust on putting business and economic interests first.\nDuring the quizzing by committee members representing Hong Kong's business community, Tung blasted the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's largest, urging it to drop its anti-China stance and to play a positive role in the transition for the sake of Hong Kong's 6.3 million people.\n\"At present they are objecting to anything Chinese,\" Tung said. \"This is not good in the long term or for the interests of Hong Kong.\"\nThe Democrats are boycotting the Selection Committee, condemning its mission to pick the post-colonial leader as undemocratic and its task of assembling a new provisional body to supplant the elected legislature as a violation of handover pledges made by China.",

Some members of the pro-China lobby predicted the law would be replaced by a more Chinese-style legislation after the handover on July 1.\nThe territory is also preparing for a visit by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord on Wednesday.\nLord, who is also heading for China amid signs of a thaw in Sino-U.S. ties, plans to meet Governor Chris Patten and his deputy Anson Chan, as well as China's hardline envoy in the territory, Zhou Nan, and shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa, the favourite in the contest to be the first post-colonial leader.\nCritics said Lord's meeting with Tung would be an undiplomatic signal from the United States tantamount to Washington picking the winner in the contest.\nFresh attacks on China are also expected on Wednesday from democrats in Hong Kong's elected legislature, which is set to be dissolved upon the handover and replaced with a new provisional body assembled under China's supervision.\nLast week a Selection Committee of 400 rich or influential Hong Kong people, formed under China's careful control, quizzed Tung and two rivals over their policies and attitude to China.\nTung, 59, emerged as the most vocally pro-China contender, loosing off a volley of remarks that stressed loyalty and patriotism to China, attacked Patten's politics and threw in a snub on the inauspicious quality of the governor's residence.\nThe tycoon also suggested the Democratic Party, the territory's largest, should stop confronting China if it wanted to participate in post-handover political establishment, which drew an attack from Patten.\n\"You can't, nobody can, freeze out of the political debate in Hong Kong, out of the dialogue about Hong Kong's future, those who represent majority opinion in Hong Kong,\" Patten told Hong Kong's government-funded radio on Saturday during his visit to Japan.\nThe 400-member Committee will meet again on December 11 to vote for the new chief executive. Most people now consider Tung's rivals Ti Liang Yang, a former chief judge, and businessman Peter Woo, rank outsiders.\nMany Hong Kong people were unimpressed by last week's performances, not least the territory's pro-democracy camp.\n\"Only empty promises and brief outlines were provided in their platforms,\" said legislator Fred Li of the Democratic Party.\nHe decried the fact Hong Kong's voters were not involved in choosing among the three contenders. \"All they need is the blessing of these 400 people,\" Li said.",

It's one on which progress is being made. Mr Zhou said he expected that we would have a decision announced in the JLG soon -- my guess is probably in early January,\" Lambert said.\n\"It now seems fairly obvious that you do not have to be physically present in Hong Kong to protect your interests if you are already a permanent resident of Hong Kong before the transition,\" he said.\nHowever, Lambert said questions remained about political and working rights of Hong Kong emigrants who return to live in the territory after 1997.\nOf all Western nations, Canada has one of the largest immigration relationships with Hong Kong.\nApart from some 500,000 Hong Kong people who have emigrated to Canada in recent years, some 30,000 Canadian citizens live in Hong Kong, many of them originally Hong Kong citizens.\nPress reports in Hong Kong have quoted British officials warning of a chaotic mass return of Hong Kong emigrants if China insists on them being in Hong Kong in person on the July 1 handover day in order to keep their residence rights.\nChinese officials have said in the past that this would be their bottom line, but the JLG has reached no agreement on it.\nCanada has delayed a decision on granting visa-free entry to holders of a new Hong Kong passport to be issued after the handover, pending guarantees from China on the repatriation of Chinese who enter Canada illegally.\nReplying to a reporter on Tuesday, Lambert denied Canada had any grounds to believe the SAR passport had been compromised from a security viewpoint.\nBalloch declined to confirm or deny that significant numbers of Chinese illegal immigrants had entered Canada using Hong Kong documents that were illegally issued or obtained.\nThe envoys also denied local press reports that Canada had received a comprehensive list of Chinese dissidents living in exile in Hong Kong, and that it planned to grant them refuge after 1997.

Many in Hong Kong have raised fears of a breakdown in law and order, including when the handover takes place at midnight on June 30.\nOfficers taking early retirement packages privately voice anxiety that Hong Kong's police will become tarnished by China-style corruption after the handover.\nPro-democracy politicians have warned that China could impose repressive laws and use its PLA garrison troops, whose colleagues crushed pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989, to keep order and put down protests.\nAsked by Reuters if the police might call in the PLA to help deal with disturbances after the handover, Hui said: \"I hope not. I can't foresee any situation which I cannot handle, which would require the assistance of the People's Liberation Army.\"\nHe said the exodus of officers from the service had not dented the force's ability to deal with mass disturbances in this freewheeling city of 6.3 million people.\n\"The senior officers who are leaving have little to do with crowd control,\" he said, adding that the force had sent many officers abroad for training in recent years and was prepared to deal with any outbreak of unrest.\n\"The overall manpower situation is very sound,\" he said.\nPolice Deputy Commissioner for Operations, Peter Wong, dismissed suggestions that the police were being pushed by China to get tough with political demonstrators, after a year of confrontations involving pro-democracy groups hostile to China.\n\"We're under no pressure from anybody in dealing with demonstrations,\" Wong said, adding that the Hong Kong police respected the population's right to demonstrate peacefully.\nThe enforcement of Hong Kong laws would remain solely the prerogative of the Hong Kong Police, he said.\nHui said 155 expatriates had asked to retire in the run-up to the handover, representing just five percent of the total of 3,000 senior officers on the force.\nAsked to give reasons for the police's success in whittling down crime, Hui said he had sent more police out on the beat.\n\"We have moved a lot of our officers to the front line, to the streets, to make our presence more visible,\" he said.\nHe said Beijing's crackdown on crime last year had contributed to a more peaceful Hong Kong, where crime often has mainland links.\nHe said cooperation with Chinese police would be stepped up after the handover when Hong Kong's Interpol office, now a sub-group of Britain, would become a sub-group of China.\nThe force is to drop the word \"royal\" from its name and abandon the British insignia on July 1.\nBut it will continue to work in both English and Chinese and will retain exclusive responsibility to maintain law and order and police the Hong Kong side of the border with China, he said.",

It is Christmas in Britain's last major colony, but will it ever be like this again?\nThe most spectacular Christmas light displays in the world are strung from Hong Kong's skyscrapers, featuring giant illuminated Santas and reindeer covering entire facades, beaming a rainbow of colours along the famed Hong Kong harbour skyline.\nHong Kong -- shopping paradise of the world -- is awash with Christmas. Its glass and marble malls brim with exorbitant festive displays, its shops push the fanciest, most expensive brand names in the world, specially repackaged for the season.\nBut after Britain pulls out and Communist-ruled china takes over next July, what then?\nWill Christmas turkey, Christmas pudding and Christmas cake be allowed to grace the yuletide dinner table? Even if it does, will it taste the same?\nWill revellers pull Christmas crackers and drink themselves silly in merriment as many do today?\nWill China allow bourgeois extravagance and Western customs? Will charities run their \"Operation Santa Claus\" fundraising drive for the disadvantaged and underprivileged? Will Christians be free to worship at Midnight Mass?\nIf China lives up to its promises, the answer to all these questions is a resounding \"yes\".\nChina has promised to allow Hong Kong to retain its freewheeling capitalist system for a further 50 years, as a quasi-autonomous part of the motherland under a \"one country two systems\" policy. This means freedom of religion will stay. And the hybrid cocktail of customs and traditions, too.\nHowever, many of Hong Kong 6.3 million people worried that pro-democracy protests such as a Christmas Eve vigil and the mass dispatch of Christmas cards to mainland dissidents by human rights groups on Tuesday might not be allowed again.\nIt is also doubtful if Queen Elizabeth's Christmas broadcast will ever again be on Hong Kong public radio and television.\"\nChristmas is still going to be a holiday next year in Hong Kong, as is the other main Christian festival, Easter.\nOnly the Queen's official birthday and World War Two victory holidays are to be removed after China takes over.\nAnd, in this overwhelmingly ethnic Chinese territory, there are more non-Chinese than ever, despite the gradual departure of expatriate colonial civil servants and company executives.\nThere are 37,000 Americans, 33,000 British and 30,000 Canadians, enough to keep a few Christmas parties going. The largest foreign group, 140,000 Filipinos, mostly brought in as servants, are also a strong Christian community.\nNevertheless, there are misgivings how much will remain the same in Hong Kong. And there's a whiff of melancholy and pre-nostalgia among expatriates this festive season.\nIt's almost like a \"last supper\", their minds tilted towards midnight next June 30, 1997, the moment when the British flag will be furled away here forever.\nHong Kong Governor Chris Patten's annual \"Christmas Song Choice\", which will be aired on local radio, reflects the mood.\nHis selection starts with Louis Armstrong singing \"Basin Street Blues\", followed by \"As Time Goes By\" by Jimmy Durante.\nPatten gathered his family and friends on Wednesday night, Christmas night, for a traditional dinner of roast turkey.\nAll assembled were aware it could be the last Christmas dinner in the regal Government House overlooking the harbour.\nPatten's successor Tung Chee-hwa, who will be Hong Kong's first Chinese leader, has indicated he doesn't want to live in the mansion that symbolises Hong Kong's one and a half centuries of British colonial rule and 150-plus years of China's national shame. He says the residence is cramped and inauspicious.\nSo no more Christmas there, at least.\nHong Kong's final year as a British colony has seen the balance of power tilt into China's orbit, even before the change of flag arrives. Chinese influence waxed and Britain's waned.\nHowever, just as Christmas has become a commercial success in Japan, the festival will inevitably live on -- Chinese-style.\nHong Kong Chinese vie with each other to lavish expensive presents on their children.\nEven over the border in mainland China, Christmas shopping sprees are catching on. There, Santa Claus has taken to riding a rickshaw, instead of a sleigh.",

Beijing will say 'wait a minute, who bailed you out in the early 1980s and who put you in this position?\" Lee said.\nBut his party would try to work with Tung if he won. \"We are quite prepared to cooperate with the chief executive irrespective of the personality involved...we cannot carry on as a political party without dialogue with the chief executive.\"\nLee denied accusations by Tung that the Democratic Party was anti-China. \"That's clearly wrong.

We are not. China is our country. I have yet to see him side with Hong Kong on any key issue, like the provisional legislature,\" Lee said.\nBritain and the Hong Kong democrats have criticised China's plan to scrap the elected Legislative Council and install a provisional legislature next July as an attempt to kill off democracy.\n\"It's going to be the most disastrous thing. Once you allow China to set up an effectively appointed legislature when under the Joint Declaration we were promised an elected legislature, you are actually accepting that China can break the Joint Declaration at will. So what other provision is safe?\" Lee said.\nHe said Beijing had made clear the new legislature would pass repressive laws to control the freedom of the press and the freedom of assembly. \"There can be little doubt that the rule of law as we know it will not be there any more. Freedoms can no longer be protected.\"\nLee said 134 candidates nominated for the provisional legislature this week would all take orders from Beijing.\n\"You would not find even five of them who could be called democrats, by any stretch of the imagination.\"",

And he will be at the helm of what is at once an economic powerhouse and a dynamic, sophisticated metropolis,\" Governor Chris Patten, Britain's last colonial chief, said in a statement congratulating Tung on his victory.\nIt is a mission that has no precedent.\nThe territory that Tung governs will be the first British colony to have matured into a world trading economy and then handed back to a communist-ruled motherland.\nChina has promised the territory of 6.3 million people a great degree of autonomy and at least 50 more years of untrammeled capitalism but vowed to curb the pace of democratic reform.\nThe 59-year-old tycoon saw his fortunes almost dashed in the 1980s when the family firm met ill winds, but Beijing helped bail him out with a syndicated loan, and his firm regained its strength.\nIn his new role, Tung will have to tack between pro-democracy politicians who branded his triumph the death of democracy, the departing colonial British with their sense of lost empire, and a proud Beijing Communist leadership keen to set the stamp \"This is China\" on the map of Hong Kong forever.\nThe vocal pro-democracy lobby plans to challenge his authority with a no-confidence vote in the current legislature.\n\"What Hong Kong needs most is a champion for Hong Kong people as we face the unprecedented challenges of the handover -- not a spokesman for China,\" said Democratic Party leader Martin Lee.\nSome analysts predicted Hong Kong's own version of China's \"red princelings\" -- sons and daughters of senior Communist Party officials -- would move to centre stage from now.\nMembers of families closely tied to the Beijing government since the 1950s are favourites for the 60 seats in the new legislature or roles in Tung's inner advisory cabinet.\nThe new elite will look to people such as legislator Leung Chun-ying, a policeman's son who has emerged as Beijing's trusted lieutenant in the transition process.\nThe princelings also include figures such as Timothy Fok, eldest son of Beijing's most trusted man in Hong Kong, tycoon Henry Fok, a kingmaker in the contest that Tung won.\nTung must now swiftly lay down a gameplan for the next six months with Beijing, political analysts said.\nHe must also work closely with the politicians and business titans likely to be brought into the post-1997 provisional legislature and advisory cabinet known as the Executive Council.\n\"He will start out with a unity of support behind him at least from the more moderate and pro-China in Hong Kong,\" said political analyst Michael DeGolyer of the Baptist University.\n\"I think he's going to have to move rather rapidly to talk to the people in Beijing. He is going to have to move rather rapidly to meet with Provisional Legco (Legislative Council) members,\" DeGolyer said.\nTung's first bite at his realm will come on Thursday when the China-controlled Hong Kong Preparatory Committee crafting 1997 power structures meets over the border in Shenzhen city.\nVery soon, Tung will also have to talk to Hong Kong's popular top civil servant, Chief Secretary Anson Chan.\nTung has said he would like to keep Chan as chief secretary but her past defence of Patten's democratic reforms may have dented her credibility and spoiled her chances of staying on.\nTung is keen not to rock the boat and has said he aims to keep as much of the civil service intact as possible. \"Nobody wants the present administration to be turned into a lame duck,\" Tung said before the vote.",

An official of the China-controlled committee supervising the three-week registration process said 217 people had requested application forms, so there could be more contenders at the last minute.\nAmong 33 incumbent lawmakers who have applied are Legco speaker Andrew Wong, whose bid startled the political community last weekend and sparked fears that Legco could disintegrate.\n\"Cracks which have already emerged within the Legislative Council over the bid by some members for a seat on the provisional legislature will widen in the next six months,\" said political commentator Chris Yeung.\n\"When you have two bodies from which laws emanate at the same time, there's going to be some confusion and dispute,\" said analyst Michael DeGolyer of Hong Kong's Baptist University.\nThose wanting a seat in the new chamber also include 11 ex-lawmakers and 22 former election contestants defeated in 1995 elections in which pro-democracy groups led by the Democratic Party fared strongly.\nThe 1995 losers applying for a seat include prominent pro-Beijing politicians such as Tsang Yok-sing, Peggy Lam and Elsie Tu.\nApplicants also include 47 newcomers to legislative contests, many of whom are members of the hand-picked 150-member Preparatory Committee crafting the post-1997 Hong Kong power structures on behalf of China's communist rulers.\nOther newcomers are members of the 400-strong Selection Committee. This is the China-backed panel that will chose the first post-colonial leader on Wednesday, with the winner forecast to be conservative-minded shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa. The committee will also be responsible for selecting the provisional legislative body on December 21.\nAn opinion poll published on Monday by the independent daily Ming Pao showed Hong Kong people split over the legitimacy of the provisional legislature.\nThe poll showed 32 percent supporting the body, 30 percent against, and 38 percent voicing no opinion. A sample of 983 respondents were surveyed by telephone for the poll.\nThe Democratic Party, the largest in the Legco with 19 seats, are absent from all China-controlled transition bodies.\nThey have boycotted the selection process, branding the provisional legislature as undemocratic and illegal, and have vowed to challenge its legitimacy in the courts.\nThe threat has forced Beijing's representatives in Hong Kong to consider locating the interim legislature in mainland China in the transitional period.\nBritain has condemned China's plan as reprehensible and unnecessary and has ruled out all cooperation with the body.",

But some pro-China politicians and analysts were sceptical.\n\"The move itself is bound to be futile. Even if the bill is passed by the present Legco, I don't think there is any chance that it can survive the handover,\" said Tsang Yok-sing, leader of the biggest pro-Beijing political party in the territory.\n\"This decision will not be useful because the Chinese side will eventually roll back all the reforms undertaken by the Hong Kong government before July 1997,\" said analyst Sunny Lo at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\"The Hong Kong government is trying to commit suicide by putting this legislation through Legco,\" Lo said.\nHe said China would want a broader definition of subversion that would include subversion in non-violent forms.\nBeijing had previously said it opposed any major changes to Hong Kong's criminal law before the change of flag.\nGovernor Chris Patten, often vilified by Chinese officials, said the government had taken the step only after 17 months of efforts to clinch agreement with China had failed.\nHe challenged China to say exactly what it objected to in the proposed new bill.\n\"We've tried to establish in a very reasonable way what these crimes should actually mean,\" Patten told Hong Kong radio during a visit to Japan. \"On this particular issue we really have been negotiating...with a brick wall,\" he said.\n\"There's been no response, no give at all,\" he said, adding that the only alternative to the bill would have been to break the government's word to Legco and the community that it would take action on the issue and ensure Hong Kong's \"decent way of life\" would not be \"swept away\" next July.\nIndependent pro-democracy legislator Emily Lau said she hoped China would not repeal the law, adding that if it did, \"that will definitely cause instability in Hong Kong, and it will be a very high price for both China and Hong Kong to pay.\"\nTreason and sedition are already on Hong Kong's law books.\nThe last time somebody was prosecuted for sedition was in 1953, and for treason in 1946. But These offences have since largely fallen.\nSubversion and secession however are new concepts in the law required by China in Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution, known as the Basic Law.",

It will be a blot on the first months of Chinese rule,\" Patten told a newspaper. \"This echo chamber has no place in the political or administrative life of Hong Kong ... We will have nothing to do with it any form.\"\nTung responded in a speech to the business community by saying Britain must \"face the reality\" of the new legislature. He warned that if its legitimacy was challenged further he would get China's parliament to legislate on its legality.\nHong Kong's biggest pro-democracy group, the Democratic Party, is boycotting the selection process, which it brands as a plot to snuff out democracy and enact repressive laws.\n\"You won't find five of them who can be called democrats by any stretch of the imagination,\" Democratic Party leader Martin Lee told Reuters, commenting on the candidates.\nThe Democratic Party has expelled a rebel member, Dominic Chan, because he broke ranks to run for the new assembly.\nThe party is organising two days of protests against the provisional legislature, and China has beefed up security on the border in case demonstrators try to cross into Shenzhen, local media quoted Chinese sources as saying.\nThe Selection Committee will choose the 60 members of the provisional legislature from a list of 130 candidates.\nPro-Beijing parties fielding candidates denied critics' allegations this week that they had negotiated the result of the voting in advance in under-the-table horse-trading.\n\"There is definitely no carve-up of seats,\" said Liberal Party leader Allen Lee.\nEach Selection Commitee member will vote by endorsing up to 60 names from among the candidates. The top 60 candidates -- those listed the most times -- will be appointed to the provisional legislature.\nAmong the candidates are 34 incumbent legislators, raising the prospect that Legco could be crippled well before Chinese rule, because the two legislatures' schedules could clash.\nA poll by Hong Kong University indicated on Thursday that one-third of the public support the concept of the new legislature and one-quarter trust the Chinese government.",

Beijing has pledged to maintain the territory's thriving capitalist system intact for 50 more years under the terms of China's \"one country two systems\" reunification policy.\nPro-democracy legislators attacked the leadership candidates in a debate on Wednesday for failing to address issues of human rights and democracy and called for a real general election.\nTrade unionist Lee Cheuk-yan told Hong Kong's existing legislature that a leading contender, shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa, was dangerous.\n\"Mr Tung is the most conservative among them, and he is the most dangerous as he calls on Hong Kong people to be willing to be obedient citizens,\" Lee said.\nBut a motion critical of the leadership selection was defeated by the pro-Beijing camp. Several democrats were absent on a lobbying mission to London.\n\"Democratisation is not like instant noodles... It took hundreds of years for Western countries to develop their present democratic systems,\" pro-Beijing legislator Ip Kwok-him said.\nThe sovereignty transition has been frought with disputes between China and Britain, between colonial governor Chris Patten and Chinese envoys, and between Hong Kong's burgeoning democracy movement and a pro-Beijing political camp.\nThey have sparred over the future of Hong Kong's human rights, democracy and basic freedoms, over whether or not the commercial \"level playing field\" will continue, and over the survival of Hong Kong's autonomy and the rule of law.\nBut now, 229 days before the sun finally sets on Britain's empire in Asia, attention is shifting to who will be running the show for China after Patten sails away.\nIn the first round of the process on Friday, the Selection Committee members will propose candidates for the chief executive who will step into Patten's shoes next year.\nTo enter the final run-off for the job, a candidate must be nominated by at least 50 members of the committee on Friday. The committee meets again on December 11 to pick the winner.\nThe leading candidates are all acceptable to China, sources close to the committee say.\nIn the forefront of the leadership battle are Tung and former chief judge Ti Liang Yang. An opinion poll gave Yang a 10 percentage point lead over Tung in public popularity this week.\nBusinessman Peter Woo and former appeals judge Simon Li came a remote third and fourth, and four other little known candidates scored less than one percent in the public's ratings.\nHowever, it is not the public who vote, but the committee, and inside that body the real lobbying campaign is unfolding.\n\"We have a process which is laid down and I think it's clear the polls don't determine the winner,\" said Woo.\nThe committee was formed in Beijing two weeks ago and is dominated by pro-Beijing political and business groups.",

List price for the orders was estimated at $5.3 billion.\nThe USAir victory follows Monday's order by Emirates, a Gulf-based airline, for 16 Airbus A330-200s worth $2 billion, which beat out a rival offer of Boeing Co's 767.\n\"The order backlog is really healthy,\" Emmanuel Dubois Pelerin, analyst at ratings agency S&P Adef said. The order book would sustain or even increase production rates for 1997 and 1998, he added.\nAn Airbus spokesman confidently forecast the consortium would rack up firm orders this year exceeding 300 planes, compared to 106 last year.\nWhile there are no worries on products and profitability for the next two or three years there are uncertainties further ahead stemming from Airbus' change in legal status and implications for projects, particularly the A3XX large plane and stretched A340 long-range jet.\nAirbus is a partnership made up of French state-owned Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (CASA) of Spain.\nIn the interests of increasing market responsiveness and competitiveness, Airbus wants to change into a joint stock company by 1999. Discussions are being held among the partners to decide the shape of the future company.\nIt also has to find external financing for the 3XX plane.\nAirbus has said it wants to find between 30-40 percent of external risk sharing for the 3XX, which it estimates will cost $8 billion to develop.\nDubois Pelerin said he believed Airbus would have to choose to build either the stretched A340-600 or the 3XX, as running both at the same time would overload its finances,\nBut the Airbus spokesman said the consortium would be able to finance development of both the 340-600 and the 3XX, with the stretched 340 a top priority in the near term.\nAirbus is under severe time pressure to come up with a rival to Boeing's monopoly at the large-capacity segment with its 777 and 747 combination which hit Airbus hard in 1995.\nBoeing is studying the 747-500X and 747-600X derivatives of its Jumbo jet, which has been a cashcow since it entered service in the 1970s, but which nearly broke the company in development.\nThe new jumbos are expected to cost around $200 million a piece, which industry sources said prompted Airbus' senior vice-president commercial John Leahy to announce earlier this week that the 3XX would cost $198 million.\nThe Airbus supervisory board last month asked for the business case for the 340-600 to be presented in mid-December to allow an early decision on whether to launch the product. If it were launched, the 376-seater could be in service in late 2000 and head off competition from the early versions of the 747.\nIf the 555-seater 3XX goes ahead, it would fly in 2003 and tackle the 747 derivatives.\nA signature earlier this week with Rolls-Royce Plc on using its Trent engine for the 3XX will allow Airbus to supply important performance data such as fuel burn, range and take-off and landing weight to the airlines it is talking to for its marketing studies.",

That is not to say competition is absent, but it is organised competition,\" said Francois Logerot, author of the Cour des Comptes (court of auditors') report.\n\"It may be that concentration in this sector is accentuated by agreements between these companies...sometimes by creating joint subsidiaries at the request of local councils.\"\nLogerot cited as an example the Saint-Etienne city council, where the water company Societe Stephanoise des Eaux is jointly owned by Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez and Generale des Eaux (CGE).\nThe report, presented at a news conference, said the private sector held 75 percent of the supply of drinking water in France in 1991, up from 60 percent in 1980 and 31 percent in 1954.\nThe price of water rose by a national average 47.7 percent from 1990 to 1994, it said.\nSignificant price rises occurred where contracts were awarded to the private sector, Logerot said.\n\"Sometimes there was a catch-up effect but there were also excesses and abnormal situations.\"\nBut CGE noted in a statement that the report said the main reason for rising water prices was higher quality and increasing investment needs.\nIt said the official audit pointed to a near doubling of the cost of water treatment between 1990 and 1995, while the price to the consumer rose by 30 percent.\nLogerot said local authorities often awarded contracts to the water companies in exchange for payments which the companies then recovered in the price charged to customers.\nThe study followed a 1995 law which banned \"right of entry\" payments that water companies paid to win an operating licence.\nThe report cited the Alpine city of Grenoble, where a contract with Lyonnaise des Eaux resulted in the conviction for bribery of the mayor, former Gaullist minister Alain Carignon.\nGrenoble used the proceeds of the water contract to finance its general expenditure, while accounting principles call for water expenses to be kept separate from the general budget.\nLyonnaise said in a statement that each water company had given details of its contracts to the audit office and, of the 12,000 in France, only about 20 had drawn explicit comment. And these had been agreed under conditions prevailing before the 1995 law.\nThe CGE statement said much of the criticism in the report related to the past, when payment for contracts was legal. It added that the company was pleased such payments had been banned and the duration of those contracts was limited.\nCGE said the water market was highly competitive and 1996 had shown that, when contracts expired, there was competition to win new licences. The sector was also subject to strict controls by a number of public bodies, including competition and quality experts.",

Both offers have been referred to the independent Privatisation Commission.\nThe preference for Lagardere seems to vindicates the integration sought by Noel Forgeard, chairman of Lagardere's Matra unit, who has fought a highly-public campaign for Thomson, in order to win its Thomson-CSF defence arm.\nThe deal will \"indisputably strengthen the missiles activity in France and particularly Europe,\" said Jean-Marc Baron, a partner specialising in defence at consultants KPMG Peat Marwick. \"The merger wil create a critical mass,\" he added.\nMatra specialises in air-to-air missiles with the Magic and Mica weapons, while Thomson-CSF has ground-to-air missiles including the Crotale NG (New Generation) and Starstreak very- short-range missile built with Shorts Brothers Plc, a unit of Canada's Bombardier.\nThe addition of Thomson-CSF reinforces a vital joint venture between Matra and British Aerospace Plc to create Matra BAe Dynamics, which Lagardere wants to be the pole for future European industrial concentration.\nBesides the missile synergy, Baron pointed to the benefits of marrying Thomson-CSF's radar and communications expertise with Matra's space satellites, which will give Thomson access to a new market.\nLagardere has major space interests with its Matra Marconi Space (MMS) joint venture with GEC Plc of Britain and also wants to use this a platform for building a single European satellite giant, to make the most of scarce funds.\nThis vertical integration of detection, communications and weapons makes the future Thomson Matra a powerful \"systems\" player rather than a seller of separate products. Each of these segments has annual turnover of about $1-$2 billion, Baron said.\nIn the United States, the defence industry has quickly consolidated through $40 billion of mergers and acquisitions to create giants such as Lockheed Martin. Integration is seen as key, with firms such as Hughes, a unit of General Motors, not only building missiles and satellites but also operating the satellites.\nEuropean and U.S. defence firms have had to adapt to shrinking military spending since the end of the Cold War and soaring research and development costs. But Europe has lagged in that restructuring due to differing national interests.\nWith the aid of Matra's links with BAe and GEC and through overtures to Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa), Forgeard wants to forge a European grouping which would have world class status in terms of turnover and product range.\nChirac launched the privatisation of Thomson SA in February as part of a restructuring of France's fragmented defence industry, widely seen by analysts as a vital step toward a badly needed consolidation of European capacity.",

But it lacks large planes to compete with Boeing's 777 giant twinjet and the best-selling 747 jumbo.\nThe four-nation consortium differs with Boeing over the potential market and development costs for a new large plane.\nAirbus forecasts a market of 1,383 planes seating more than 400 passengers over the next 20 years, while Boeing believes demand would only stretch to 470 planes seating 500 or more, which would not allow it to get a return on its money.\nA basic A3XX would cost around $200 million, giving potential sales worth more than $275 billion on the Airbus forecast.\n\"A split market would have been a big challenge for two manufacturers but now Boeing is opting out, that enhances our prospects,\" the Airbus spokesman said.\nAirbus accepts the view that the market will fragment further as people want to fly more frequently, non-stop, long distance between city pairs.\nThe \"fragmentation\" effect was one of the factors cited by Boeing for cutting demand for larger planes and reducing the importance of big airport hubs.\nBut Airbus believes it will meet that market change with its A340 long-haul plane and that the A3XX will co-exist.\nSaturation of air routes and airport landing slots calls for higher capacity planes, it argues. Countering critics who point to already lengthy waits at airports, it says its A3XX designs would allow a quicker passenger turnaround than the jumbo.\nAirbus is talking to 14 leading airlines on what the plane should offer and is confident that it can match or better the airlines' operating demands. These include fitting within an 80 metre \"box\" at the airport terminal.\nIt is officially sticking to its estimated $8 billion development cost for the A3XX, despite scepticism among some experts that it cannot be done for less than $15 billion.\nAirbus is a consortium made up of French state-owned Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, British Aerospace, Daimler-Benz Aerospace (part of Daimler-Benz) and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.",

They were at 9.15 francs when they were suspended on September 30 in the runup to the debt deal.\nAnalyst Jean Borgeix at broker Pinatton said the stock market was disappointed with the 10.40 franc price that banks will be getting new Eurotunnel shares at as part of an eight billion franc equity-for-debt deal.\nThe market had been looking for a conversion price of between 12-15 francs per share, he said.\nCurrent shareholders also stand to effectively \"lose\" 30 percent of Eurotunnel's future cashflow, as this is the percentage earmarked for paying the \"stabilisation notes\" it would issue to banks in return for an interest-free credit line.\nThe company negotiated the right to issue the stabilisation notes in case it fell short of cash to meet interest payments. It can issue up to 14.8 billion francs of the notes.\nFactoring in that loss of future cashflow gave the shares a present value of around 8.5 francs a share.\nAnother French analyst said: \"The restructuring assures the industrial viability of the project, even though the shares remain a risky investment.\"\nThe debt deal looked good on paper and the zero-interest stabilisation notes provided Eurotunnel with a last line of defence if its cash failed to meet interest payments, he said.\nA trader at a major U.S. brokerage in Paris said the share price suffered from the dilution of equity due to the debt pact.\nThe restructuring will dilute the holdings of current shareholders to 54.5 percent of the capital after the debt swap.\nThe complex agreement also includes issuing eight billion francs of bonds redeemable in shares, which could further dilute the equity holders to 39.4 percent if the banks exercised their conversion rights at 12.40 francs per share.",

If they announce a good figure...that might help, but it's really a face-off between the company and the bankers,\" Olivier Machou, analyst at brokerage Leven said.\nEurotunnel needs to agree a refinancing of its $12.3 billion bank debt by the end of September, having asked in July for two court-appointed mediators to stay on to negotiate a deal with its some 220-strong bank syndicate.\nMachou said it was hard to forecast results due to \"dumping\" in the price war between Eurotunnel and ferry companies as they battle for a share of cross-Channel traffic between Britain and France.\n\"It's not a stock that you can take a view based on half-year figures, especially as the first half comes before the summer season,\" one analyst said.\nHowever, one analyst at a large French brokerage said he had a rough forecast of a 2.5 billion franc ($492 million) net loss and an operating loss of around 100 million.\nThe Channel Tunnel operator posted first-half sales of 1.79 billion francs, up from 806 million a year ago. It made a net loss for the full year last year of 7.196 billion francs on turnover of 2.266 billion.\nThe headline figures will likely be flattered by the fact that Eurotunnel did not have all its services running a year ago, said Jeff Summers, head of research at debt specialist Klesch and Co in London.\nStripping out the minimum usage fee that the railway operators pay, he expected a 25-30 percent improvement in the underlying results from a year ago.\nIn sterling terms, Summers has pencilled in a 22 million pound ($34.45 million) pretax, pre-interest loss versus 121 million a year ago. With benign currency movements, it may break even.\nOperating cashflow should at least double to 56 million sterling before interest and capital expenditure, compared with 29 million.\n\"Everything is going in its favour,\" Summers said. He cited the British government's recent decision to allow cooperation between ferry companies to pool their capacity and the European Commission's decision not to extend the duty-free sales regime beyond 1999.\nPooling by rivals such as P&O and Stena would lead to \"a reduction in direct competition\" for Eurotunnel, while the loss of duty-free sales, representing 250 million sterling of soft subsidies for the ferries, would push ferry firms to raise ticket prices.\nEurotunnel could then raise its prices and boost turnover.\nThe cross-Channel market has also grown much faster even than Eurotunnel forecast, with traffic up 20 percent last year and estimated growth of 13-15 percent this year, Summers said.\nRichard Branson, head of the London & Continental Railways (LCR) group which runs the Eurostar high-speed train concession, has forecast it will hit six million passengers in the financial year 1996/97 and 10 million in 18 months.",

It has been privatised for ideological reasons\", he said.\n\"I was shocked by the method, which was despicable and perhaps even illegal as the 1986 (privatisation) law specifically called for the parliamentary privatisation committee to give a supporting opinion,\" he said.\nJacques Delors, former president of the European Commission, told a conference in Paris on Sunday, \"I would have preferred to maintain a European pole in consumer electronics.\"\nOn Monday, French business newspaper La Tribune Desfosses added to the controversy by reporting that a French businessman, whom it did not identify, was preparing a bid for Thomson Multimedia to keep the company French.\nThe report said it was only after the government declared its preference last Wednesday for Lagardere's bid over a rival offer from Alcatel Alsthom that authorities realised \"the value of the gift it (the state) was making to Daewoo.\"\nA Thomson-CSF spokesman declined to comment on the report of a \"white knight\" bidder.\nA Lagardere spokesman said bids had closed in September and if investors were interested in Multimedia, they would have to negotiate with Daewoo after it had bought the firm.\nJospin said French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Alain Juppe were allowing the sale of Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo, which would reap the benefits of French state financing for the group's digital technology.\n\"Thanks to state finances, it will be able to take up a strong position in the digital (television) market and be profitable from 1999,\" Jospin said.\nThomson Multimedia is set to make big profits in 1999, when revenues from technology licences will contribute at least one billion francs ($192.3 million) a year. The licences were acquired when Thomson bought RCA of the United States from General Electric in 1987 but only revert to Thomson after 1998.\n\"We are not hostile to a foreign company taking control of Thomson Multimedia as it follows an industrial and economic logic,\" a spokesman for the Thomson-CSF association of employee shareholders said.\nBut, he added, it was a pity the state had not played its part as a shareholder to recapitalise the group earlier.\nA source close to Thomson said the group's financial situation was untenable as its share capital was insufficient to sustain its debt and that it was in dire need of fresh funds.\nBut the government is tightening its belt as it cuts public spending to meet tough requirements to join the single European currency by 1999. The Thomson privatisation was also launched as part of the government's consolidation of the defence industry.\nThe Thomson Multimedia unit, the world's fourth-largest TV maker, reported a loss of three billion francs in the first half of 1996. It has invested heavily in digitial television technology and is a leader in television decoders, as well as a being a member of the Digital Video Disc consortium.\nThe chairman of the South Korean company, Bae Soon-Hoon, has said he is ready to invest $1.5 billion in France and create 5,000 new jobs if he wins Multimedia.",

The enlarged group would have annual sales of around 15 billion francs ($2.9 billion).\n\"The government has been advised of Snecma's wish to raise its holding in the capital of SEP from 51 percent to 100 percent and has given its approval so Snecma's board can make a public offer for SEP shares, followed by, if the 95 percent threshold is reached, a mandatory buy-in,\" the Finance Ministry said in a statement.\nThe deal has a strong industrial logic and would ensure Snecma's future in space programmes and its position as France's centre for engine manufacture, it said.\nSEP makes engines and boosters for Ariane rockets, used by the European Arianespace consortium.\nSnecma makes civilian and military aero engines including those for passenger jets of the Airbus Industrie consortium and Dassault Aviation combat planes.\nThe buy-in, for which no financial details were available, reverses a policy drawn up by Snecma's previous chairman, Bernard Dufour, who wanted to dispose of SEP and Messier Bugatti, Snecma's aircraft brakes unit, to raise cash.\n\"Previously envisaged, the sale of SEP is no longer on the agenda\", said a Snecma staff note made available to Reuters.\nAlthough the SEP sale would have brought in fresh cash, it also risked weakening the Snecma group by losing know-how essential for future transports such as a second generation supersonic plane and hypersonic aircraft, the note said.\nIt would also have meant the loss for SEP of Snecma's technical support, which has helped it in the past.\nSnecma's new chairman, Jean Paul Bechat, has said asset sales should not be used to make up operating losses and that the company's deficits would only be tackled by meeting a targeted 1.5 billion francs in cost cuts in a restructuring plan.\nIn addition, the government has adopted an industrial policy for the defence sector which relies on consolidating each sector on a business basis. Snecma was thus the natural centre for SEP, to build a propulsion group in aeronautics and space, it said.\nThe move would also consolidate Snecma's brakes activities by bringing together SEP's Carbone-Industrie subsidiary with Snecma's Messier Bugatti to create a bigger entity.\nBrakes make up around eight percent of Snecma's sales, with potential to grow into areas such as cars and trains.\nThe buyout will help SEP through a difficult period in the next few years as its order book falls when the Arianespace space consortium transfers launches to the new Ariane 5 rocket from the existing Ariane 4.\nSEP makes the rocket motors for the Ariane 5, which has one huge Vulcain engine instead of the up to 10 Viking and HM 7 motors in Ariane 4. Competition from the United States, Russia, Ukraine, China and Japan is also expected to put severe price pressure on rocket launchers.\nSEP also makes ballistic missiles and its proposed M5 replacement for the M45 was only adopted in the six-year defence budget on condition that there would be big cost reductions and reorganisations among the industrial partners.\nThe takeover will create a group with synergies in aeronautical and space engines, making it virtually unique in Europe, a Snecma spokesman said.\nSnecma made a 1995 net loss of 1.24 billion francs and expects to make a loss in 1996 and next year before returning to profit in 1998. Turnover for 1996 is expected to total 9.2 billion francs, up from 8.6 billion in 1995 but still lower than 1994's 10.39 billion.",

That is not to say competition is absent, but it is organised competition,\" said Francois Logerot, author of the Cour des Comptes (court of auditors) report.\n\"It may be that concentration in this sector is accentuated by agreements between these companies...sometimes by creating joint subsidiaries at the request of local councils.\"\nLogerot cited as an example the Saint-Etienne city council, where the water company Societe Stephanoise des Eaux is jointly owned by Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez and Generale des Eaux (CGE).\nThe report, presented at a news conference, said the private sector held 75 percent of the supply of drinking water in France in 1991, up from 60 percent in 1980 and 31 percent in 1954.\nThe price of water rose by a national average 47.7 percent from 1990 to 1994, it said.\nSignificant price rises occurred where contracts were awarded to the private sector, Logerot said.\n\"Sometimes there was a catch-up effect but there were also excesses and abnormal situations.\"\nLyonnaise officials were not available for comment. But CGE noted in a statement that the report said the main reason for rising water prices was higher quality and increasing investment needs.\nIt said the official audit pointed to a near doubling of the cost of water treatment between 1990 and 1995, while the price to the consumer rose by 30 percent.\nLogerot said local authorities often awarded contracts to the water companies in exchange for payments which the companies then recovered in the price charged to customers.\nThe study followed a 1995 law which banned \"right of entry\" payments that water companies paid to win an operating licence.\nThe report cited the Alpine city of Grenoble, where a contract with Lyonnaise des Eaux resulted in the conviction for bribery of the mayor, former Gaullist minister Alain Carignon.\nGrenoble used the proceeds of the water contract to finance its general expenditure, while accounting principles call for water expenses to be kept separate from the general budget.\nThe CGE statement said much of the criticism in the report related to the past, when payment for contracts was legal. It added that the company was pleased such payments were banned and the duration of those contracts was limited.\nCGE said the water market was highly competitive and 1996 had shown that when contracts expired, there was competition to win new licences. The sector was also subject to strict controls by a number of public bodies, including competition and quality experts.\nThe audit office called for tighter water management and said higher water quality standards contained in a 1992 law would require annual investment of around 14 billion francs.",

The diamond-shaped F117 and batwing B2 bombers were designed to absorb or deflect radar.\nBut traditionalists who admire the sleek greyhound lines of warships would be dismayed to see the flat, angular shapes forced by the stealth technology which makes modern ships mere \"platforms\" for weapons and detection systems.\nThe La Fayette uses a slab-sided superstructure and non-metallic composite materials to confuse radar and missiles. The second of eight La Fayette-class ships ordered by Taiwan entered service last week, while Saudi Arabia has also ordered the French ship.\nBut the British are in hot pursuit with their own designs for a new generation of stealth vessels, which they say they are ready to build now. They have set their sights firmly on export markets for the first customers.\n\"We believe this is the warship of the future and all warships will need to use these techniques,\" Brian Spilman, Vosper's manager of future projects shipbuilding, told Reuters.\nThe Sea Wraith design puts the distinctive clutter of mast, radar dishes and aerials inside flat-sided towers and has shaped topsides, rather like diamond facings, to make it hard for radars to lock on. It also uses non-reflective composites.\nSea Wraith can alter its \"radar signature\" by lowering or raising the mast, making it difficult to recognise the craft. Two asymetrically-located masts are meant to confuse radar-guided missiles.\nTo counter new infra-red, or heat-seeking, missiles, the ship sprays a fine mist of water to conceal itself and its \"hot spots\" such as the exhaust.\nBAeSema is showcasing the Cougar patrol vessel, which uses low-acoustic waterjet propulsion instead of traditional noisy engines which are easily picked up by sonar.\nIts low, angular lines are typical of stealth designs for throwing off radar beams.\nBAe last week announced it was merging its naval systems activities into BAeSema, to boost its prime contractor role.\nPrime contractors bid for contracts in which their integration of radar, communications and defence systems provide the added value.\nBoth BAeSema and Vosper have declined to give prices for their ships, saying these depend on the systems requested.\nThomson-CSF, part of the French state-owned Thomson SA electronics group which is being privatised to the Lagardere conglomerate, is the prime contractor for the La Fayette under Sawari 1 and 2 contracts signed with Saudi Arabia.",

The improvement will come from pruning down Schneider to core electrical activities and an internal re-engineering programme.\nSchneider shares have risen strongly in the past few weeks as analysts considered the stock undervalued and welcomed the pending sale of the Spie Batignolles unit, which has dragged on the group's results.\nThe stock has risen around 10 percent since mid-December when news of its Spie sale hit the market. The shares closed on Wednesday at 255.70 francs. About a third of the capital is in non-domestic hands.\nAll the group companies are profitable and with the sale of construction company Spie Batignolles, Schneider is at a \"diamond point,\" Staib said.\nStaib did not rule out further disposals depending on market and technology changes but Schneider is now well-focused.\nSchneider will seek growth in emerging markets, in South America and Asia, including India. It wants Asia to contribute at least 20 percent of group turnover before the end of the decade compared to 11 percent in 1995.\nSchneider has expanded its operations in China, increasing the number of employees to 2,500 from 200 five years ago.\nThe company also wants to increase its share in Germany from a tiny three to four percent of a market which Staib says is the world's third largest. Germany accounted for 2.5 percent of turnover in 1995, or three billion francs.\nIt will seek alliances with other industrial companies rather than acquire firms, as the Germany market is tightly held. Expansion in emerging markets will also be done through local alliances and joint ventures.\nSchneider last year bought out Daimler-Benz AG's 50 percent share in AEG Schneider Automation unit.\nSchneider posted 1995 sales of 59.42 billion francs and net attributable profit of 817 million. It reported 1996 first half net profit of 503 million francs, at the low end of market expectations.\nSchneider is selling Spie to Amec Plc and to Spie employees for one billion francs, subject to regulatory approvals. Amec will gain between 40-48.6 percent of Spie for an injection of 40 million stg.",

        "Text": "A restructuring agreed between Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel SA /Plc and bank negotiators on its 69.6 billion francs of debt was a \"robust\" deal, French co-chairman Patrick Ponsolle said on Monday.\nHe told a news conference the restructuring was robust as it would eliminate a total 16 billion francs of debt by swapping eight billion of loans into equity and a further eight billion for equity notes.\nThe plan secured the company's future until 2003, when the London-Folkestone high-speed rail link would be built, he said.\n\"After 2003 we will see an explosion of revenues from the railways,\" Ponsolle said.\nThe restructuring meant the interest bill would be fixed at 5.2 percent or 3.21 billion francs for the seven-year period. That rate was much lower than market rates, the company said.\nIf there is a cashflow shortage to repay interest, it will be able to draw down on stabilisation notes, which are effectively a credit line, free of interest until January 2006.\nThe plan also pushed back the debt repayment periods by a significant period, Ponsolle said. The resettable bonds mature in 2050, the participating loan notes in 2040, the remaining junior debt in 2025 and stabilisation notes in 2026.\nEurotunnel has also negotiated the right to refinance all its debt after 2004, free of penalties, to benefit from any improvement in market conditions. Previously, that refinancing incurred heavy financial penalties.\nThe deal had been worked out using a wide range of scenarios and sought to preserve the company's future and independence, Ponsolle said. \"It is the best compromise under the circumstances. The sacrifices for shareholders and banks are equal and equitable.\"\nThe two chief aims of the deal were \"to preserve a clear majority for the shareholders and to ensure long-term financial stability,\" he said.\nAlthough the company planned to pay a first dividend in around 10 years, if it performed very well it could make a payment at the date envisaged in the 1994 rights issue -- 2004.\nAsked what would happen if shareholders rejected the deal, Ponsolle said, \"I think we would go back to the choices at the starting point. The starting point was either we come to a friendly agreement or insolvency.\"\n\"I think, contrary to some, an insolvency could only be a catastrophe for the small shareholders.\"\nPrices should rise \"to a reasonable level\" following the merger announcement last week of P&O and Stena of their cross-Channel operations, Ponsolle said.\nThe merger news had come as a surprise to Eurotunnel, which had not expected such a move until later, perhaps in 1997, he said.\nThe earliest Eurotunnel could hold a shareholders' meeting to vote on the deal would be late March or early April, he said.",

        "Text": "The outcome of a bidding war for Conrail Inc is increasingly likely to be decided by its investors, who will ultimately determine if the railroad should strike an $8.5 billion deal with CSX Corp when a $10 billion offer is also on the table.\nWall Street experts said Conrail was unlikely to be swayed from its planned merger with CSX despite a higher bid lobbed Friday by Norfolk Southern. \"Nothing has changed. I think a lot will depend on what happens with the shareholder vote,\" said Jeff Medford of William Blair & Co.  \nConrail has agreed to a stock and cash transaction with CSX valued at about $8.5 billion. Norfolk Southern, which had already outbid CSX, earlier Friday sweetened its all-cash offer to $10 billion.\nShareholders are considered key to the Conrail-CSX transaction because Pennsylvania corporate law prohibits CSX from buying more than 20 percent of Conrail in a tender offer without their approval. A shareholder meeting is slated for mid-December.  \nSome shareholders have expressed unhappiness with the proposed CSX transaction. Conrail \"won't win the shareholder vote,\" predicted one arbitrager.\nArbitragers, who have been among the most vocal opponents of the Conrail-CSX deal, said that Norfolk Southern would further strengthen its position by aggressively urging  Conrail shareholders to defeat the CSX proposal.\n\"It's got to be like Bob Dole's marathon, but with a more successful conclusion,\" said one, referring to the 96-hour campaign blitz launched by the losing U.S. presidential candidate in the days before this week's election.  \nNorfolk Southern chairman David Goode declined to be specific about the company's plans to woo shareholders.\n\"The numbers in our bid speak for themselves. It should be readily apparent that it's a superior offer. We're willing to talk to all of the constituencies involved, including shareholders and others who are interested in this, and we are doing that,\" he told Reuters in a telephone interview.\nConrail has said it will review the new Norfolk Southern offer, but the Philaelphia-based railroad also has defended the CSX transaction as a better strategic match.  \n\"We have high regard for Norfolk Southern and its board, but we simply do not believe that a sale of Conrail to Norfolk Southern is in the best interest of Conrail and its constituencies,\" Conrail wrote Norfolk Southern on Thursday before the bid was raised.\nThe new Norfolk Southern bid reflects an 18 percent premium over CSX's plan, which values Conrail at about $93 per share. Norfolk Southern has raised its bid to $110 per share.\nShares of Conrail rose 2-1/4 to 95-1/4 after the new bid.\nWall Street experts said Conrail and CSX, which already revised the terms of their transaction once, may feel pressured again to increase the portion of cash in their deal. However, most industry experts do not expect a revised bid to top the offer made by Norfolk Southern.",

It was not immediately known when talks resumed.\nUnder the agreement, Kash n' Karry shareholders will receive $26 per share in cash. The companies also said Food Lion will refinance $221 million of Kash n' Karry debt.\nSupermarket chains have been gobbling each other up rapidly in a wave of industrywide consolidation.\nThe deal came one day after California-based grocery giant Safeway Inc. offered $2.3 billion for the 65.5 percent of supermarket chain Vons Cos. Inc  that it doesn't already own.\nEarlier this year, Dutch group Ahold NV bought Massachusetts-based grocer Stop & Shop Cos. for $1.8 billion.\nSalisbury, N.C.-based Food Lion is a unit of Belgian retailer Delhaize.\nFood Lion is one of the 10 largest U.S. supermarket chains with more than 1,100 stores in 14 states. Kash n' Karry has 100 food stores and other facilities in west central Florida.\nShares of both companies were halted for trading shortly before the market closed. Earlier, Food Lion shares were up 6.25 cents to $8.56 on Nasdaq and Kash n' Karry stock rose 25 cents to $24, also on Nasdaq.\n\"This agreement will enhance competition in west central Florida by putting the financial resources of Food Lion behind the Kash n' Karry name, enabling Kash n' Karry to position itself more effectively as a viable competitor with the area's major supermarket chains,\" said Tom Smith, chief executive officer of Food Lion.\nFood Lion said it planned to invest up to $150 million to improve Kash n' Karry stores in the next four years, with funding expected to come from Kash n' Karry cash flow from operations.\n\"While allowing us to continue operating our stores under the Kash n' Karry banner, it gives us access to the capital we need to accelerate our store remodeling programme and grow our business,\" said Kash n' Karry Chairman Ronald Johnson.\nThe companies said the transaction will increase earnings per share for Food Lion and result in cost savings. They were not specific.\nThey also said the deal, which is expected to close by early 1997, has been been approved by Kash n' Karry's board of directors. The board will also recommend that Kash n' Karry shareholders support the merger.\nInstitutional investors who together own more than 51 percent of Kash n' Karry common stock also support the deal, the companies said.\nFood Lion said it has received a commitment from Chase Manhattan Bank to arrange and syndicate a new credit facility that will replace Food Lion's current borrowing facility and provide financing for the deal.\nPaineWebber Inc. submitted a fairness opinion to Kash n' Karry's board and is acting as financial advisor to Kash n' Karry in connection with the transaction.",

        "Text": "CSX Corp may be hard-pressed to top an aggressive and pricey bid for Conrail Inc. unleashed Wednesday by rival Norfolk Southern Corp.\nThe Norfolk Southern $100-per-share offer came just eight days after CSX agreed to acquire Conrail in a cash and stock transaction valued at $8.4 billion, or about $92.50 per share.\n\"This (Norfolk Southern) bid comes without any regulatory risk, is all cash and is higher. So it's one-two-three - a knockout punch versus the old bid,\" said Anthony Hatch of NatWest Securities.  \nAt the very least, CSX will likely be forced to change its cash-and-stock offer to an all-cash bid if it wants to stay in the game, railroad and merger experts said.\n\"The Norfolk Southern bid is a very high bid. It's a rich premium and an attractive deal for Conrail shareholders. I don't know if CSX will be able to come up with an all-cash bid,\" said Carole Neely of Brown Brothers Harriman.\nNorfolk Southern's bid did not completely surprise Wall Street because the Virginia-based railroad last week had expressed concern about the proposed CSX-Conrail transaction.\nBut some were startled by the nature of its offer.  \nNorfolk Southern's bid aims to lure Conrail investors by offering immediate payment for their stock. It would then place the shares in a voting trust until the deal closes.\n\"The Norfolk Southern offer takes the risk away from (Conrail) shareholders. You've got to be impressed with that,\" said one takeover stock trader.\nUnder last week's Conrail-CSX agreement, Conrail shareholders would be required to authorize the tender of 40 percent of Conrail shares for placement in a voting trust. The rest of the shares would be exchanged for stock at a later date and would be subject to market fluctuations.  \nShares of Conrail, which said it will review the Norfolk Southern offer, soared 11-1/4 to 96.\nThe bid by Norfolk Southern represents its second attempt to buy the railroad that was formed by Congress in 1976 out of the remains of six bankrupt entities. Rumors about Norfolk Southern's interest in Conrail have surfaced on Wall Street periodically ever since it unsuccessfully tried to buy the railroad from the government in the 1980s.\n\"They're not usually very aggreesive from a financial point of view, but they've been keeping their balance sheet clean for a long time,\" Hatch said about Norfolk Southern.  \nCSX and Norfolk Southern are eager to capture Conrail's valuable Northeast presence amid widespread industry consolidation.\nEarlier this year, Union Pacific Corp bought Southern Pacific Rail Corp  for $3.9 billion after losing a fight for Santa Fe Pacific Corp, which was won by Burlington Northern Inc for $2.5 billion in 1995.\nBut unlike those acquisitions in which the target was viewed as a weak market player, Conrail is considered to be a much stronger railroad - a factor that could limit any potential cost savings or benefits to the successful bidder.\n\"Southern Pacific and Santa Fe were both not doing well and there was a lot of turnaround opportunity. Conrail is not sick. It's not a big turnaround situation and this is not a cheap price,\" said Cornelius Sewell of Argus Research.",

A company spokesman confirmed the figures.\nIndustry analysts dismissed the earnings drop, saying Mobil's stock price had already reflected the poor industry fundamentals. Instead, Wall Street appeared more intrigued with the company's future cost-cutting plans.\n\"They have done an excellent job and I think they are determined to maintain the cost cutting,\" said Jack Aydin of McDonald & Co Securities Inc.  \nSome investors already have expressed concern about Mobil's ability to keep up its aggressive pace.\n\"People are wondering if they have squeezed everything out of the cost structure that they can and if their magic touch is over,\" said Smith Barney analyst James Falvey, who upgraded Mobil to a buy rating from outperform on Monday.\nChairman Lucio Noto sought to allay any concerns.\n\"Since we are in a very competitive industry that has significant price volatility, changes in the way we run our business are essential if we are to compete in the long term,\" Noto said in a news release about the company's earnings.  \nAlthough Mobil is not expected to announce a major restructuring plan anytime soon, future savings are anticipated from purchasing and technology.\n\"Everybody has cut a lot of the fat and even some of the muscle,\" said John Parry, analyst at energy consulting firm John S. Herold Inc.\nAnd Mobil is likely to soon start reaping benefits of its joint venture with British Petroleum Co Plc that calls for the merger of their downstream  operations in Europe.\nThe success of the joint venture will likely impact Mobil's plans for future savings as other firms also pursue similar pacts. Texaco Inc, Royal Dutch Shell Group and Star Enterprise are now exploring joining downstream operations. Star is a venture of Texaco and Saudi Arabia's state oil firm.\nIf other companies pursue such ventures and the BP pact is successful, analysts said Mobil eventually may seek a downstream partner in other parts of the world.\n\"I think the easy part of the cost cutting and restructuring has been announced.

I don't know how they're going to get enough votes if they don't,\" said Thom Brown, managing director at investment firm Rutherford, Brown & Catherwood Inc., which holds some 50,000 shares of Conrail.\nRichmond, Va.-based CSX and Conrail declined to comment on their plans, but acknowledged last week that they are discussing increasing the value of the pact upon its consummation.\nSources close to the companies said there is no rush to make a decision, noting that Conrail can easily postpone the shareholder vote that is now slated for mid-December.\nCSX and Conrail won a significant victory this week when a U.S. district court judge denied a request by Norfolk Southern to block the CSX-Conrail proposal. An appeals panel also declined to block the deal's first step, but will consider Norfolk Southern's request for an expedited appeal.\nBecause Pennsylvania corporate law prohibits a company from buying more than 20 percent of another company in a cash tender offer, shareholders will be asked in mid-December to approve a measure that would permit CSX to buy 40 percent.\nThe CSX-Conrail transaction calls for CSX to buy 40 percent of Conrail shares for $110 per share in cash and exchange the remaining 60 percent for CSX stock.\nSources close to the company said Conrail and CSX were well aware of the potential difficulties in winning the necessary votes.\nIndustry experts believe shareholders may be more willing to approve the 40 percent measure if they are guaranteed more favourable terms for the stock portion of the deal.\n\"They can't get the vote until they improve the back-end of the deal and they know that,\" one takeover specialist said.\nMeanwhile, Conrail stock fell sharply on the New York Stock Exchange, reflecting the expiration of CSX's cash tender offer for the first 20 percent of Conrail's shares at $110 per share.

He said it would be a longterm investment for CGIP.\nSeilliere declined to discuss a potential price for the stake owned by De Benedetti's holding company Cerus.  \nCGIP's efforts to buy a piece of Valeo moved a step closer late Thursday, when it sold half of its 20 percent stake in Crown Cork & Seal Co Inc for $560.6 million.\nCGIP has said that profits from the sale would be used to finace the stake in Valeo.\n\"Now we have sold part of our assets, obviously we are seen as serious to buy Valeo, but we still have a way to go. We are serious about what we are doing,\" Seilliere said.\nCGIP is a holding company with industrial and information technology investments.\nSeilliere said the purchase of a stake in Valeo would fit its strategy to invest in firms that have a global presence. Seventy percent of Valeo's business is outside of France, he said.\nHe also dismissed the potential of Valeo falling prey to the cyclical nature of the autmotive business, saying that opportunities abound in growing economies around the world.\nHe noted that CGIP previously held a stake in Valeo and sold it in 1993. He also said that the company does not need any significant productivity or organizational changes.  \nAlthough Seilliere appeared hopeful that a deal for the Valeo stake will be struck, he also said that CGIP would certainly consider another investment if the Valeo acquisition falls apart. He did not name any potential companies.\nRegarding its stake in Crown Cork, which now totals 10.1 percent, Seilliere said CGIP's relationship with company had not been affected by the partial sale of its investment.\n\"Our team is still there. Nothing has changed,\" he said, noting that CGIP still has more than $600 million invested in the company.\nCGIP decided to sell a portion of its Crown Cork & Seal holdings after investors and analysts expressed concern that packaging had grown to 50 percent of CGIP's assets, up from about 21 percent in 1986, Seilliere said.",

Over the past several years, dozens of world airlines have entered into such pacts.\nThe USAir move cames amid increasing hostility between it and its British partner. British Airways earlier this year announced plans to form a massive alliance with powerhouse AMR, parent of American Airlines Inc.  \nThe move infuriated USAir, which promptly sued the two carriers and contended that their planned pact would undermine the USAir-British Airways partnership.\nAlthough the relationship had certainly turned rocky, most analysts had not expected USAir to sever the tie until the proposed British Airways-AMR pact was finalized. That proposed alliance has raised antitrust concerns, awaits regulatory approvals and is linked to other aviation issues.\n\"Clearly, it's difficult to simultaneously sue a partner and cooperate with a partner,\" said Samuel Buttrick of PaineWebber.  \nBritish Airways said in London that it would continue to work with USAir until the pact is terminated.\nAt the time the partnership began in 1993, USAir was a money-losing airline that desperately needed to reduce costs and expand its global presence. British Airways invested $400 million under the partnership, but refused to pump any more money in the carrier because of its poor financial performance.\nSince then, USAir's financial position has improved amid healthier times for the airline industry, but its costs are still higher than other major U.S. carriers.\n\"At the time the alliance was made, USAir received the cash which it needed, but today, it doesn't need it,\" said Glenn Engel of Goldman Sachs.\nUSAir's future plans are now more uncertain with the decision to sever ties with British Airways, especially because chief executive officer Stephen Wolf has stressed that he wants to expand USAir's transatlantic presence.\n\"I'm a little mystified. They don't have anything to replace it with yet,\" said Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette analyst James Higgins.",

Norfolk launched its $100-per-share bid on Oct. 23.\nSince then, Norfolk Southern and CSX have vehemently attacked each other's offers and landed in court.  \nThe CSX-Norfolk Southern relationship between took a new twist Monday when the companies announced they were holding discussions about their bids, but offered conflicting accounts about the talks. Uncertainty about those talks prompted sharp stock declines on Monday.\nIndustry experts said Conrail is likely to defend the lower CSX bid by citing the strategic benefits of the transaction and the lack of potential legal problems associated with the friendly deal. Legal expoerts have said that Pennsylvania takeover law could impede a Norfolk Southern acquisition of Conrail.  \nExperts also speculated that Conrail may try to convince CSX to sweeten its offer in an attempt to appease shareholders who may be upset by the rejection of a higher bid.\nRailroad industry experts have said that CSX likely cannot afford to match Norfolk Southern's $100 cash offer, but may be able to restructure the bid to increase the cash portion of the transaction.\n\"I think it is a strong likelihood that any positive reaction from Conrail's bid toward the Norfok Southern bid will force CSX to sweeten their bid,\" said Carole Neely of Brown Brothers Harriman.",

The stock dropped $3 after the transaction was announced on Tuesday.\nWall Street analysts said the deal was strategically sound from a long-term perspective, but noted that investors were wary of the company's shift into a new area.\n\"The scepticism, which we don't share, is related to the company's going into a business outside their consolidation within the ambulance industry,\" said Randall Huyser of Furman Selz.\nHouston-based STAT Healthcare provides staffing for hospital emergency rooms. It also offers outpatient medical services such as kidney dialysis.\nIndustry sources also cited the company's prediction the deal will slightly dilute earnings this year.\nIn a conference call with investors and analysts on Tuesday, American Medical Response said the transaction will add to earnings in 1997. It also anticipated cost savings of $2.5 million from the merger.\nIndustry analysts noted that the acquisition marked a logical extension of its existing services by branching out into the hospital emergency room and providing more services for clients.\n\"They're taking it beyond just driving you to the hospital,\" said Clifford Hewitt of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co Inc.\nIndustry sources also noted that shareholders of STAT Healthcare were likely to be concerned about the steep stock decline because the transaction was not based on any fixed price for American Medical Response shares. The deal calls for each share of STAT common stock to be converted into one-quarter share of American Medical Response.\nOfficials from both companies could not be reached for comment.\nSTAT stock fell 87.5 cents to $7.375 on Nasdaq.\nAnalysts expect American Medical Response to continue its tradition of buying ambulance companies as it works to integrate the STAT acquisition.\n\"I think the outlook for this company is very good. There are 12,000 ambulance companies in the U.S. and they aren't geared to the needs of medical care as it is evolving,\" said Hewitt.",

They want the slice of cake,\" said John Gray, executive director of the International Foodservice Distributors Association, which helped fund the study released this week.\nIndustry executives this week said they are developing fresh strategies to feed 18-to-24 year olds -- a generation that grew up with working mothers and microwave ovens.\n\"Cooking from scratch is diminishing: many consumers in 2005 will never have cooked a meal from basic ingredients,\" said the study by consulting firm McKinsey & Co Inc titled \"Foodservice 2005: Satisfying America's Changing Appetite.\"  \nThe study confirms trends that food manufacturers and food distributors already are seeing: harried consumers bypass the fresh meat and spice aisles of a supermarket in favor of sections selling barbecued chicken and ready-made salad.\nThe study projects the food industry will grow 1.6 percent per year to nearly $800 billion a year by 2005.  The foodservice sector is expected to capture nearly all of the anticipated incremental sales, pegged at $100 billion.  \n\"There is going to be a whole new plethora of different foodservice opportunities,\" said William Eacho, president and chief executive officer of  Atlantic Food Services, a Virginia-based foodservice distribution company.\nTomorrow's supermarkets are expected to have drive-up windows where consumers can buy ready-made meals.\nExecutives also envision stores that group food by meal categories so that shoppers can head right to the breakfast aisle instead of wandering throughout the store.  \nThe changes are expected to be especially challenging for food manufacturers, who may see shelf space for their products shrink as stores provide more ready-made products.\nNabisco Holdings Corp already is experimenting with ways to ensure its products are not lost in the shuffle.  The maker of items such as Oreo cookies and Grey Poupon mustard wants to leverage its brand popularity into ready-made meals.\n\"As a major food manufacturer, we ought to have our fair share of that growth,\" said Henry Lambert, president of Nabisco's food service company.  \nThat may mean developing a Grey Poupon-based sandwich spread for supermarket sandwiches or working with a dessert manufacturer to sell individual slices of cheesecake that contain Oreo cookies, Lambert said.\nAnd demand for those kinds of products is expected to grow as consumers spend less time preparing meals.  Industry experts estimate people now spend about 20 minutes preparing a meal versus two hours of preparation time about 50 years ago.\n\"The meal is not the social setting of the evening anymore.

Wall Street rumblings began earlier this week and the rumor picked up steam after a Thursday report in the New York Post.  \nThe New York Post cited a rumor on Wall Street that Philip Morris would offer $50 a share for PepsiCo.\nThe speculation of a deal with Philip Morris comes less than one month after PepsiCo announced a major plan to pull out of weak international beverage markets.\nThe restructuring, which called for a charge of more than $500 million against earnings, also included cost-cutting targets and continued focus on its Frito-Lay snack food unit.  \nBut Wall Street is disappointed with the company's indecision about its casual restaurant business, which has performed below expectations. PepsiCo said it is reviewing those operations and analysts widely expect the company to eventually sell the business.\nIn the meantime, earnings growth will rest heavily on the strong Frito-Lay division.  \n\"In 1997, a large (part of PepsiCo earnings) is going to be riding on the shoulders of Frito-Lay. Frito-Lay, in my opinion, has to deliver next year,\" said Skip Carpenter of Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, who does not anticipate a major turnaround for the international beverage business until 1998 or 1999.\nAnalysts said PepsiCo reported third quarter earnings on Tuesday that met expectations, but failed to excite investors.\nIf PepsiCo sells the restaurant business as expected, the company may pour some of those proceeds into acquisitions to further beef up the solid snack food business, analysts said.  \nAnalysts also have dismissed recent rumors that PepsiCo would be interested in buying Starbucks Corp. They said a transaction between the two would likely dilute PepsiCo earnings and disappoint investors who want the company to exit the casual dining business.\nBoth companies declined to comment on the PepsiCo-Starbucks speculation.

It makes sense to have the Alamo fleet as a warehouse for his vehicles,\" said Andrew Jeffrey, analyst at Robertson Stephens & Co.\nAlamo is the fourth-largest rental car company in the United States, with a fleet of about 130,000 vehicles. Alamo operates in 42 states in the United States and has operations in 10 European countries and Canada.\nAlamo founder and Chairman Michael Egan, who owns about 94 percent of the company, will continue as chairman of Alamo.\nHuizenga said Republic's AutoNation USA car business will benefit from Alamo's strong relationships with manufacturers and other automotive suppliers.\n\"The combination of Alamo with Republic's 'like-new' automobile retailing concept is an exceptional fit that will enable AutoNation USA to accelerate its business plan and create a unique, dedicated and predictable source of inventory for our megastore distribution system,\" he said.\nRepublic bought used-car company AutoNation earlier this year and opened its first superstore about two weeks ago in Florida. It plans to open three or four more AutoNation stores this year and quickly expand the chain so there are some 80 stores around the nation by the end of the decade.\nAutoNation will be supplemented by Republic's recent $95 million purchase of used-car superstore firm CarChoice Inc.\nInvestors praised the latest acquisition by Republic, bidding the company's stock up $2.875 to $33.625 on Nasdaq. The deal will be accounted for as a pooling of interests.\nIn addition to the automotive industry, Republic specialises in electronic security and solid waste companies. Huizenga also owns the professional Florida Marlins baseball, Panthers hockey and Dolphins football teams.\nHuizenga suffered a setback in late September when his plan to buy security firm ADT was called off after weeks of uncertainty. Although the stock deal was viewed positively from a strategic standpoint, it fell apart due to volatility in Republic's stock and the inability of the companies to revise terms of the transaction.\nAnalysts saw little chance of that happening with Alamo.\n\"I think Alamo provides Republic everything that ADT did, plus more, from the auto side,\" said Jordan Hymowitz of Montgomery Securities, who rates Republic shares as a buy.\nRepublic also said it will pursue more car deals.\n\"We're interested in growing in virtually every segment of the automobile industry,\" spokesman Ronald Castell said, citing rental, used cars, repairs and financing.\nThe acquisition of Alamo marks the latest in a flurry of transactions in the rental car industry.\nOn Wednesday, ADT said it planned to sell its U.S. auto-auction business, ADT Automotive. The unit is the nation's second-largest automobile auction company, and its sale would mark ADT's complete exit from that business after it sold its European auto-auction unit last year.\nLast month, hotel and real estate operator HFS Inc. bought Avis Inc., the world's second largest car rental company, for about $800 million. HFS has said it will pursue another similar acquisition and launch an initial public offering for part of its rental car subsidiary next year.\nFord Motor Co., which owns Hertz, in July announced it was expanding its rental car business with the acquisition of Budget Rent-a-Car.

Previously, the regional security firm served six western states.\nAt a recent conference on mergers in the security industry, Protection One officials declined to discuss potential revenue from the alliance, but noted that capturing even 5 percent of PacifiCorp customers would be significant.\nCustomers accepting the offer will receive free installation of a home security system with the purchase of a two-year agreement for monitoring services.\nThe security system's alarm panel also will hold thermostat and lighting controls and remote access.\nThe alliance is expected to be just the first step for Protection One, which is trying to take advantage of new opportunities that are emerging from deregulation of the utilities and telecommunications industries.\n\"We think this is the first of quite a few announcements we'll be making in the next 12 months or so,\" Protection One Chief Financial Officer John Hesse told Reuters at the recent security conference.\nThe alliance re-establishes a link between the two companies that was dissolved several years ago. Protection One began as a subsidiary of PacifiCorp in 1988, but the alarm company split off in a management buyout three years later.

These guys are general merchandisers,\" said Gary Vineberg of Merrill Lynch.\nGrass addressed those issues in the conference call, saying that Rite Aid may add more merchandise experts to assess the different products.  \n\"There are certain lines of merchandise that we will continue to carry out West that we don't carry back East,\" Grass said.\nShares of Thrifty PayLess, which made its initial public offering in April at 14 per share, gained three to 21-3/8. Takeover stock traders said the deal values Thrifty PayLess at $23.32 per share.\nThe proposed acquisition of Thrifty PayLess seems to eliminate Rite Aid as a potential bidder for southeast drugstore chain Big B Inc.  Rite Aid has been viewed as a possible bidder for Big B, which is fighting a hostile takeover from Revco D.S. Inc.\nBut in announcing the Thrifty PayLess acquisition, Rite Aid also said that it is pulling out of Florida, Alabama and Georgia, which are Big B's key markets.",

Norfolk Southern soon launched its own bid of $100 cash per share, or about $9 billion.\nSince then, the two companies have been locked in a fight over their rival offers and taken the matter to court.\nCSX, which said Norfolk Southern initiated the talks, said the discussions concerned \"a possible sale by the post-merger CSX/Conrail of certain material assets.\"\nMeanwhile, Norfolk Southern sought to quell speculation that it would abandon its bid for Conrail, saying that it was committed to its offer and has secured more than $15 billion to finance the proposed acquisition.\nNorfolk Southern said the talks were started by CSX, adding that they were aimed at promoting competition.\n\"Our willingness to talk to CSX at its suggestion is consistent with my previously announced position that Conrail cannot be acquired by either CSX or NS without a plan to maintain a balanced competitive structure for Eastern railroad service. While I am heartened by CSX's willingness to discuss these matters, we have no reason to believe that Conrail is prepared to accept that reality,\" said Norfolk Southern Chief Executive Officer David Goode.\nA battle for Conrail is viewed as being rife with difficulties for all the companies. Although Norfolk Southern has a higher offer on the table, analysts have said that Pennsylvania's corporate takeover law could be an obstacle to its proposed acquisition.\n\"This is not a good time to be having a long, drawn-out fight. The quicker they get to this, the better,\" said analyst Anthony Hatch of NatWest Securities.\nConrail shares had partly recovered from the early steep fall by late afternoon, trading down $1.50 per share at $93.75 on NYSE. CSX rose $1.50 to $44.50 and Norfolk Southern gained $1.375 to $90.75, also on the NYSE.",

It makes Valvoline motor oils and owns SuperAmerica convenience stores.\nSome industry analysts have said that Ashland, which is trading at around $46 per share, would be worth more than $60 per share if its businesses were separated.\nProvidence has formally told Ashland that it has nominated a three-man slate for election to the board at the January 30 annual shareholders' meeting. Shareholders will be asked to fill six slots on the 16-member board.  \nAshland spokesman Dan Lacey said the company has hired First Boston Corp to advise it on the proxy issue. A source familiar with the situation said Ashland also may discuss strategeic alternatives with investment firm Wasserstein Perella & Co, which has worked with Ashland in the past.\nSources said New York-based Providence is not seeking control of Ashland, but instead wants to push a restructuring. Founded in 1991 by a group of merger experts at Jefferies & Co, previous investments have included California Microwave, Duplex Products Inc and Ideon Group Inc It also has invested in Russia.  \nAshland earlier this month acknowledged Providence's interest, noting that it holds 100 shares of Ashland's 64 million outstanding common shares.\nAshland has declined to comment further on Providence, noting that it is prohibited from discussing the issue until it files documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a move that is expected by mid-December.\nProvidence and Wasserstein also declined comment. Sources said both Ashland and Providence recently have held meetings with institutional investors to discuss shareholder value.  \nIndustry experts think Ashland is primed to participate in industrywide consolidation, especially as Ashland veteran and Chief Executive Paul Chellgren moves into the role as chairman. He is replacing retiring longtime Chairman and former Chief Executive John Hall.\n\"Under his leadership, Ashland could be restructured along individual lines of business. If done correctly, we think it could lead to an increase in shareholder value of 25 percent or more,\" Bear Stearns & Co analyst Fred Leuffer said in a report issued Monday.\nThe push for a restructuring comes as giant oil firms join forces to combat poor refining profits. Texaco Inc and Shell Oil Co are mulling an alliance of U.S. refining and marketing operations, while Mobil Corp and British Petroleum Co Plc have a similar venture in Europe.\nAnd smaller refiners also are seeking partners. Diamond Shamrock Inc has proposed a merger with Ultramar Corp, Tosco Corp is buying Unocal Corp's West Coast refining assets and just last week refiner Valero Energy Corp said it was seeking an alliance for its natural gas services unit.",

He accused Markey of trying to use government as a \"big brother\" to impose his own scheme. And Valenti vowed not to bend under pressure and alter his group's system.\n\"We're not going to change a word of it. We're not going to redot an 'i' or recross a 't,'\" Valenti said. \"If there is any intervention by government, we're going to be in court in a nanosecond.\"\nThe Federal Communications Commission also must approve or reject the ratings system. If it were to reject it, the agency could call for development of an alternative plan -- one that Valenti said the industry would ignore.\nOnce the ratings are implemented in January, Valenti did say the industry would revisit the system after about a year to determine whether it should be changed or \"tweaked.\"\n\"Is it perfect? Of course not. All subjective systems are flawed. So is ours,\" Valenti said.\nThe ratings -- expected to include six broad categories -- will not apply to news, news magazine shows such as \"60 Minutes\" or sports. TV networks and syndicators will issue the ratings, with the categories \"mingling\" age and content, according to Valenti.\nProposed guidelines leaked to the media include two for children: \"TV-K\" for kids and suitable for all ages; and \"TV-K7\" for children older than seven.\nThe other four are: \"TV-G\" for general audiences; \"TV-PG,\" parental guidance suggested; \"TV-14\" for parents strongly cautioned; and \"TV-M\" for mature audiences only.\nThe rating are to be used in conjunction with a \"V-chip\" installed in TV sets that allow parents to block out shows they consider too violent or racy.\nThe HBO system, developed in the mid-80s, offers ratings such as \"MV\" for \"mild violence,\" \"SC\" for \"strong sexual content\" and \"AL\" for \"adult language.\"\nBut Valenti said that system is unworkable and is too complicated to appear in TV listings in the newspaper.\nHe also said a 19-member monitoring and oversight group will be created to oversee the new ratings. It will include a chairman and representives from the creative side of the industry, TV broadcasters and the cable-TV industry.",

        "Text": "The federal government's bid to pry open the phone business has hit a snag that could postpone the onset of full-blown competition in the local and long-distance markets and delay cheaper phone service.\nThe snag came when a federal appeals court Tuesday suspended, or stayed, key parts of a Federal Communications Commission rule opening local phone monopolies to competition from long-distance carriers, cable TV operators and others.\nExperts said the action could postpone competition in the $100 billion local phone market now controlled by the regional Baby Bell phone companies, until the case makes its way through the courts in coming months. A final decision could easily take a year or more.\n\"We're in for a very messy 1997, and the dust won't settle until fairly deep into 1997,\" said Henry Geller, a former top telecommunications official in the Commerce Department.\nThat, in turn, could delay the Baby Bells' entrance into the $70 billion long-distance market. The telecommunications law enacted in February lets the Bells offer long-distance only after they have opened their own markets to new rivals.\nEven before the appeals court acted, government officials suggested a prolonged delay of the FCC's rules would make it tougher for regulators to allow the Bells to enter the long-distance business.\nThe FCC -- along with the Justice Department and state regulators -- has the final say over whether the Bells have satisfied a 14-point \"checklist\" that includes provisions of the now-suspended FCC rule.\n\"If the stay chills investment and retards new entry into the local marketplace, it may become more difficult for the (FCC) to authorise the Bell companies to offer long-distance (service),\" FCC Commissioner Susan Ness said in a speech only hours before the appeals court order.\nAnd she noted that the Justice Department -- whose views \"must be accorded 'substantial weight'\" by the FCC -- already has signalled it will be reluctant to support Baby Bell entry as long as as the key parts of the FCC's proposed rules are on ice.\nDavid Turetsky, deputy assistant attorney general in the department's antitrust division, said last month a stay would \"seriously impair\" the Bell entry process spelled out in the telecommunications law.\nAny delays could delay the benefits of competition that Congress and President Clinton promised when enacting the law.\n\"The sooner there is competition in the local market, the consumer will benefit. And that's for sure when the Bells are allowed to go into long distance,\" said Geller.\n\"That will result in marketing and price wars. And the consumer again will greatly benefit.\"\nBut Baby Bell stocks rallied after the ruling because state regulators were likely to call for lower discounts when the companies lease their phone lines to new competitors, analysts said.\nGTE, the nation's largest local phone company -- which has spearheaded the legal challenge to the FCC rules -- jumped $3.625 to $42.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.\nBellSouth added $2.50 to $38.875, Bell Atlantic gained $2.125 to $60.875, NYNEX rose $1.625 to $44.50, Ameritech was up $1.75 to $56.125 and Pacific Telesis rose $1.28 to $34.66, all on the NYSE.\nThe appeals court suspended the FCC rule until the judges consider a challenge to the measure early next year by GTE Corp., the Bells, other local carriers and state regulators.\nThey argue the FCC overstepped its power by requiring the Bells and local carriers to lease their phone lines to new competitors at steep discounts of up to 25 percent.\nThe court's action, for now, puts back in the hands of state regulators the responsibility to set such prices.\nBut local phone company officials discount the chance that competition will be delayed.\n\"The Telecommunications Act of 1996 passed by Congress in February is the law of the land and sets forth a timetable for the introduction of competition,\" said GTE Senior Vice President William Barr. He said that timetable is \"unaffected\" by the court's action and will proceed.",

The channels would be made available through the transition to high-definition digital TV.\n-- $14.8 billion through the sale of the analogue spectrum now occupied by TV broadcasters. The frequencies also would become available in the transition to digital TV.\nThe administration wants to speed up the return of the analogue spectrum to the government by requiring stations to return it by 2005. The auction would be held in 2002.\nBut broadcasters want to postpone any auction.\n\"We remain opposed to upfront auctions or accelerated giveback of broadcast spectrum. We expect the government will receive full value for spectrum once the broadcast industry transition to digital is complete,\" said Dennis Wharton, a spokesman for the National Association of Broadcasters.\nThe NAB supports an FCC plan for an approximately 15-year transition to digital broadcasts.",

Supreme Court Justice Thomas had declined to restore them.\nIt was a victory for the regional \"Baby Bell\" companies, GTE Corp.  , other local carriers and state regulators who are seeking to overturn the rules in the appeals court in St. Louis. They argue that the FCC unfairly snatched from the states power to issue policies governing pricing and other matters.\nThe rules spell out how long-distance companies, cable-TV operators, utilities and others wanting to get into the local phone business can plug into local networks under the new federal telecommunications law.\n\"For all practical purposes the states have complete control over the prices new entrants will pay to share the existing telephone networks during the critical period when competition is supposed to begin in local telephone markets,\" FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said after the high court's denial.\nThe appeals court temporarily suspended the rules last month, saying the FCC probably erred when it drafted them.\nOn Oct. 31, Justice Thomas declined a request by the FCC and its long-distance allies to lift the lower court's \"stay.\" They separately asked Justices Ruth Bader Ginsberg and John Paul Stevens to reconsider the request, and the justices referred the matter to the entire court.\n\"The stay prevents grossly arbitrary and distored pricing rules from going into effect and ruining the whole process,\" said GTE General Counsel William Barr. \"It does not delay the timetable set forth in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 for the introduction of competition, but instead allows for a more level playing field.\"\nOral arguments in the case are set for January. FCC Chairman Hundt conceded Friday it was unlikely the appeals court would decide in favour of the FCC, and he doubted that the rules would be put into effect for at least 1-1/2 years, if ever, while they were fought over in the courts.\nHundt was encouraged, however, by the actions of state regulators arbitrating connection agreements between the Bells and their long-distance rivals.\nHe said key provisions of the arbitration decisions issued thus far were similar to the suspended FCC rules.\nIowa, Texas, Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania have been among the states that have issued decisions that will lay the groundwork for arbitrated agreements between the Bells and AT&T, MCI and No. 3 long-distance company Sprint Corp.\n\"There hasn't been any evidence that the states are going off and doing any wild and crazy stuff,\" said analyst Robert Mayer of Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group.",

It spells out how new entrants to the local phone business can link to Bell local networks.\nThe appeals court suspended the FCC order in October, pending Friday's case. \"The FCC faces a tough uphill battle,\" said attorney Alfred Mamlet of Steptoe & Johnson. \"This case is headed for the Supreme Court.\"\nAs a result, the FCC's \"interconnection\" order is likely to hang in legal limbo for at least a year while it is fought over in court -- a prospect analysts expect will cloud the phone industry's outlook and weigh on phone company stocks.\n\"It adds to the uncertainty out there,\" said analyst Scott Cleland of Schwab Washington Research Group.\nThe order was meant to implement the 1996 communications law, which allowed local and long-distance carriers, cable-TV operators and others into each other's business.\nThe appeals court, in suspending the order, sided with the local carriers and state regulators who charged that the FCC overstepped its power by issuing national rules on pricing and other matters instead of leaving those issues to the states.\nThe court wrote that opponents \"have a better than even chance of convincing the court the the FCC's pricing rules conflict with the plain meaning\" of the 1996 law.\nWith the order expected to remain on ice for a while, lawyers and analysts said state regulators and federal judges will have the chief job of prying open local phone monopolies to long-distance companies such as AT&T Corp. and others.\nFCC Chairman Reed Hundt warned that piecemeal deregulation -- with judges around the nation ultimately deciding terms for opening local phone markets -- would have a \"very negative impact\" on industry efforts to raise capital.\nFCC officials have said the case will not be resolved before the high court until spring 1998, at the earliest.\nThe order requires the Bells and other local carriers to lease their phone lines to new competitors at discounts of up to 25 percent.\nThe FCC also ordered local carriers to \"unbundle\" their local networks into pieces -- such as call-switching devices and operator and directory assistance -- so new competitors can lease components to complete their own networks.\nThe \"unbundled elements\" were to be priced at competitive levels based on the cost of new and more-efficient facilities.\nIn the meantime, state regulators have been issuing decisions on terms for opening the local markets. FCC Chairman Hundt said that despite the suspension of his agency's order, 29 of 31 states so far have adopted the FCC pricing policies.\nBut even those decisions are being challenged. GTE Corp. in particular, as well as AT&T, have appealed some of those rulings to federal courts around the country.\nHenry Geller, a former FCC general counsel, blamed the legal morass on Congress, saying lawmakers \"botched\" the job of writing the 1996 law. \"The whole idea was that the courts weren't going to be determining this,\" he said.",

The average price for a license to provide \"personal communications services,\" or PCS, tumbled more than 90 percent.\nPCS technology is expected to turn the wireless phone into a mass-market product, allowing consumers to use different communications services -- such as phone, paging, fax and Internet access -- through a single handheld device.\nThe drop reflected the flood of new entrants into the wireless phone market, a dearth of new money after the sky-high prices paid at last year's PCS sale, and the smaller slice of airwaves covered by the new licenses, analysts said.\nThe top bidder this time around was a unit of No. 3 long-distance carrier Sprint Corp. It bid $544 million for 160 licenses in Chicago, Houston, and Atlanta, among other cities.\nNext was a unit of long-distance giant AT&T Corp., which bid $407 million for 222 licenses in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere, followed by a unit of BellSouth Corp., which bid $205 million for 39 licenses.\nThe No. 4 bidder was OPCSE-Galloway Consortium, a consortium made up of Omnipoint Corp. of Arlinton, Va., and Galloway Entrepreneurs of Charlottesville, Va. It bid $181 million for 109 licenses.\nThe FCC sold 1,479 PCS licenses nationwide in three different blocks, making this the most licenses sold at once. A third were reserved for small companies. Markets that generated the highest bidding were New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.\nBased on the population sizes covered by the licenses, the average bid at the auction was just $3.32 a person.\nThat was down from the average bid of $39.88 at last May's \"C-Block\" sale, which was reserved for small companies. Analysts called those prices too high for companies to make much money.\nThe FCC's first PCS auction, which raised $7.7 billion and ended in March 1995, had an average bid of $15.54.\n\"It's phenomenally cheaper,\" said Jonathan Foxman, vice president of Americall International, a Phoenix-based PCS firm that bid at the auction.\nMark Lowenstein, a vice president with Boston consulting firm Yankee Group Inc., called the latest prices \"more reflective of the current market reality.\"\nAnalysts listed several factors behind the lower prices.\nThe airwave parcels sold, at 10 megahertz (MHz) each, were a third the size of the 30 MHz parcels sold at the two prior auctions and thus less attractive. The permits cover less geographic area.\nAnalysts also said the wireless market was getting crowded with companies holding PCS and traditional cellular licenses -- meaning less profits.\n\"The market is going to be too crowded,\" predicted P. William Bane, a director at Mercer Management Consulting.\nThe steep prices at last year's PCS auction meant less money available this time around. \"The latest prices are an indication that people have run out of money,\" said Bane.\nIn addition, analysts said, Wall Street has not rushed to extend financing to PCS providers.",

        "Text": "Negotiations between American Airlines and its pilots union continued into the early hours of Friday, with neither side reporting any breakthrough that would avert a midnight strike at the nation's No. 2 carrier.\nA federal mediator refereeing the talks at a downtown hotel informed the pilots that American had rejected a key union contract proposal covering who should pilot -- and at what pay -- the carrier's smaller American Eagle planes.\nMediators are shuttling back and forth between the two sides offering hypothetical \"what if\" proposals on a variety of issues in an effort the bring the two sides closer together and prevent a midnight Friday (0500 GMT Saturday) strike by the pilots which would throw the nation's air transport system into turmoil.\n\"They're going to work all night, throughout the night. All day (Friday),\" said Dave Bates, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, which represents American's 9,000 pilots.\nHe said the union is \"disappointed at the lack of progress\" so far.\n\"We will continue to negotiate for as long as it takes. But (Friday) night at midnight the pilots will be on strike.\"\nBates said no face-to-face talks had as yet been scheduled. An American spokesman would only say that the negotiations were continuing.\nGoing into the talks on Thursday evening, Kenneth Hipp, chairman of the National Mediation Board, said he was hopeful an agreement could be worked out in time to avert a strike.\nThe union had proposed that its pilots fly the American Eagle flights, but with lower pay than pilots flying the regular American aircraft. American, however, wants to continue using lower-paid commuter pilots from a different union to fly the smaller planes.\nWhile the mediator has informed the union of the airline's rejection of the proposal on small planes, union officials said the company itself has not notified them directly of that.\nThe dispute also centres around the pilots' pay. They now earn an average of about $120,000 a year.\nThe union earlier had said it would offer a new pay proposal -- probably less than the 11.5 percent over four years it had sought. The latest reported offer from American was a 6 percent boost over four years.\nA strike would ground 2,200 American flights on Saturday and affect about 200,000 passengers. American, a unit of AMR Corp., accounts for about 20 percent of the nation's airline capacity.\nThe Fort Worth, Texas-based airline is trying to rebook passengers on other carriers and has already cancelled nearly all international flights scheduled for Friday night.\nAmerican Airlines spokesman John Hotard said on Thursday the carrier was cancelling 12 of its domestic flights scheduled for Friday. \"There are some small domestic airports where we have no permanent place to park the planes if there is a strike, so we decided to cancel those 12 flights.\"\nA Transportation Department official said a strike could cost the U.S. economy up to $200 million a day.\nAmerican Airlines Chairman Robert Crandall called for binding government arbitration of the dispute, a proposal the pilots have repeatedly rejected.\n\"I think mandatory binding arbitration should be required\" to prevent airline strikes, Crandall told a congressional subcommittee. Binding arbitration would mean both parties agreed to abide by the decision of an arbitrator.\n\"I seriously doubt we could accept that,\" union spokesman Wally Pitts said.\nCrandall told a hearing of a House of Representatives Transportation subcommittee he was unsure if a strike could be avoided. \"We have two choices: we can either cave in or take a strike. A strike of 90 days will destroy this airline.\"\nAs the talks entered their fourth day of intensive bargaining, President Bill Clinton was keeping a close watch.\nClinton could intervene and name an emergency board to try to resolve the issues. Under the Railway Labour Act, which also covers airlines, the president has the power to declare a national emergency to stop a strike and to keep planes flying for 60 days. The last time such an action was taken in an airlines strike was in 1966.\nBut at an unrelated news conference on Thursday, Clinton repeated that the parties should use the government mediator to reach an agreement.",

Ltd. in June began airing TV ads for its Royal Crown whiskey in selected local markets.\nThe National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), while \"disappointed\" with the lifting of the decades-old ban by the nation's distillers, declined to embrace Hundt's call for a voluntary ban.\nHundt applauded the decision by the big networks -- ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox -- to leave unchanged their own policies against accepting liquor ads. Together, the four own about 50 stations in major markets.\nThat leaves just under 1,200 commercial stations scattered across the nation not owned by the major networks.\n\"The government has many, many options available to it. It's not necessary for these options to be explored if the broadcasters will stand up the way the four major networks have done,\" Hundt told a news conference.\nNAB President Edward Frits, however, noted that \"over the years, individual stations have adopted their own standard regarding the acceptability of hard liquor advertising.\n\"We believe this process has served American consumers well, since individual stations make and will continue to make judgments every day on what is most appropriate for their local audiences,\" he said in a statement.\nOn Thursday, the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, or Discus, said it formally ended its decades-old voluntary ban on radio and TV liquor ads. The ban had been in place since 1936 for radio and 1948 for TV.\nThe group said distillers should enjoy the same right to promote their products as beer and wine producers, whose ads are carried on TV. Over the past 14 years, liquor consumption in the United States has tumbled 28 percent, to 325 million gallons last year from 449 million in 1981.\nThe Seagram ad campaign already has unleashed criticism from lawmakers, regulators, consumer advocates and President Clinton. The FCC has opened its own probe of ads shown in Texas and New Hampshire.\nMeanwhile, other liquor makers have said they are planning their own ad campaigns or are considering their options.",

It seems to ignore the overwhelming evidence that Ameritech faces no viable local telephone competition in Michigan,\" said an AT&T spokesman. An Ameritech spokesman was not available.\nThe FCC will make the final determination on whether Ameritech has indeed met the technical checklist for entry into the $78 billion long-distance market.\nBut a negative review from Michigan would have dimmed the Chicago-based carrier's prospects considerably. The Justice Department must issue a recommendation to the FCC by Feb. 21.\nAmeritech asked the FCC on Jan. 2 for permission to provide long-distance service to residents in Michigan, one of five Midwestern states in which the company provides local phone service. Ameritech has 3.5 million customers in Michigan.\nLong-distance carriers such as AT&T and MCI Communications Corp. have called on regulators to reject Ameritech's request, saying the company has not yet opened its local market fully to competitors.\nThe Michigan commission said that in a 2-1 vote among commissioners the agency authorised the filing of its comments in the Ameritech case with the FCC.\n\"For many years, the Michigan Public Service Commission has supported allowing expanded choice for telephone customers,\" said commission Chairman John Strand.\n\"Our comments today are designed to assist the Federal Communications Commission to follow a course that will introduce more competition in the telecommunications marketplace.\"\nAfter filing its initial request with the FCC, Ameritech was forced to amend its application with an additional 1,500 pages of documents. Regulators had determined that many needed pages were missing.\nOther Baby Bells are expected to ask the FCC for similar approval soon.",

It came as TV executives raced to complete a ratings system in the next month.\nThe executives favor an approach like the alphabetical code used by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) for movies. Individual networks would rate their shows.\nBut the survey sponsors -- along with Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass. -- want a system that covers content and viewer age.\n\"Parents want it all. They want every shred of information available about every program,\" said Markey, the author of a provision in the new communications law requiring TV makers to install a \"V-chip\" in all new sets. The device can be used with the upcoming ratings to let parents block shows they consider too violent or racy.\nMarkey told a news conference it would be \"very unfortunate\" if the TV industry ignored the survey results and did not incorporate the kind of system used by the Home Box Office cable-TV movie channel to rate its shows. Each HBO show is given a rating based on content such as \"MV\" for \"mild violence\" or \"SC\" for \"strong sexual content.\"\nMarkey vowed the groups sponsoring the poll would \"scream to the high heavens\" if the TV ratings ignored program content.\nMPAA President Jack Valenti, overseeing the ratings' creation, said his group welcomed all suggestions. \"We are trying to devise a TV parental guidance system which will be family friendly, easy to understand, easy to use, and most of all grounded in honorable purposes so that parents can better monitor and supervise the TV watching of their children.\"",

They said that few people actually read the complex filings.\nOfficials said elimination of the tariff requirement removes the opportunity for long-distance carriers to tacitly collude on phone rates by getting a preview of their competitors' pricing policies.\n\"Competition will intensify and consumer benefits will increase as a result,\" said Commissioner Susan Ness.\nThe tariff filings currently take effect one day after their submission to the FCC. When AT&T was classified a \"dominant\" carrier, the No. 1 long-distance company had to wait up to 60 days. The FCC ended AT&T's dominant status last fall.\nThe new approach is the first major step the FCC has taken under a part of the new telecommunications law allowing the agency to shed outdated rules, as long as the public interest is unharmed. The new rules will take effect in nine months.\n\"We think it's a terrible mistake,\" said Mark Cooper of the Consumer Federation of America. \"You need informed choices.\" He noted that groups such as his use the data from the tariff filings to help consumers find the best phone packages and avoid questionable deals.\nIndustry officials had sought -- but without success -- to retain the option of submitting tariff filings for certain residential and small-business phone plans, saying that would make it easier for customers know their phone rates.\n\"While AT&T has always favoured less regulation, we're concerned the FCC's decision to mandate the end of tariffs will lead to more consumer confusion and possible litigation,\" said AT&T Vice President Gerry Salemme.",

Ltd. in June to begin airing TV ads for its Royal Crown and Chivas Regal whiskey.\nThat ad campaign has unleashed criticism from lawmakers, regulators and President Clinton.

The new FCC rules -- which stem from a provision in the law pushed by Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., -- are expected in early 1997.\nThe agency must decide what form of customer approval a carrier must receive before using the data for marketing.\nThe rules will determine, for example, what if any okay is needed for a carrier to use a customer's long-distance calling pattern to pitch a cellular service if a customer is seen to make plenty of calls from the road.\nMany phone companies want the FCC to avoid stringent rules requiring detailed customer approval. Industry executives argue that consumers would benefit from flexibile rules that let companies target a customer's communications needs.\n\"It would give us the opportunity to tailor their package of services to what they need and what they want,\" said James Spurlock, AT&T Corp.'s director of federal government affairs.\nBut consumer and privacy groups fear the data could fall into the wrong hands without tough curbs and clear approval.\nThey also fear an explosion in telemarketing: Companies could use CPNI to market a vast array of products and services unrelated to the phone service a customer actually receives.\n\"When consumers sign up for telehone service, they don't expect the information to be used to market non-phone services such as credit cards or investment information,\" said John Windhausen, general counsel for the Competition Policy Institute (CPI), a consumer advocacy group.\nCompanies already use the information. Long-distance carriers pitch cheaper plans based on a customer's calling habits. The marketing is expected to heat up.\nUnder contention at the FCC is whether a company can use the data derived from its long-distance business to pitch local or cellular service, without prior customer assent.\nThe telecom law lets carriers use CPNI without prior approval when supplying the service a customer ordered.\nThe FCC has proposed to classify phone service under three categories: local, long distance and cellular. CPNI from one could not be used to market another without a customer's okay.\nA number of phone companies, including several regional Baby Bell companies, have asked the FCC for just one broad category that would give them greater marketing flexibility.\nTexas phone regulators, by contrast, propose categories based on \"the exact services (the customer) has ordered.\"\nThe FCC also has proposed requiring phone companies to notify customers of their right to restrict access to CPNI.\nUnder contention is whether the notification should be oral or written, such as a notice stuffed into a bill or posted in the \"white pages\" phone directory.\nConsumer advocates, privacy groups and state regulators want advance written approval for use of the information.",

Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican, said of the widely publicized incident involving the House speaker.\nTauzin, who chairs the House of Representatives telecommunications subcommittee, has called for hearings into cellular privacy.\nFederal law makes it a crime to intentionally intercept or disclose the contents of a telephone call, regardeless of whether it is over a hard-wired, cellular or cordless phone.\nBut experts can cite only a handful of cell-phone cases that have drawn publicity. Politicians have been involved.\nJustice Department spokesman John Russell said that in the case of cellular calls, the law is \"seldom used\" and the department \"seldom\" gets complaints.\nFor one, people rarely know when they have been overheard on their cell phone. And the complicated law is little known.\nIn once case, Sen. Charles Robb, a Virginia Democrat, got into hot water in 1991 over an illegal tape recording of a cellular call made by a political rival, Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder. Robb was spared indictment. Four associates pleaded guilty in the case.\nAnother case in 1990 centered on an intercepted cell-phone conversation involving then-Rep. Bill Sarpalius, a Democrat from Texas.\nTapes and transcripts of the call -- in which Sarpalius spoke with a young woman about a date and a possible job -- were made available to local media. Two unrelated men were later fined about $250 each in connection with the incident.\nWhy the dearth of legal action?\n\"Violations of this law are very, very hard to detect. That is why there are so few cases,\" said Clifford Fishman, a law professor at Catholic University of America in Washington.\n\"The person whose privacy is invaded usually never hears about it and so does not alert authorities.\"\nWhat's more, the eavesdroppers usually are not familiar with the people they are monitoring. Penalties generally are light, except in cases involving repeat offenses or use of the information to commit another crime.\nThe only times a case does seem to arise is when the perpetrator tries to capitalize on the conversation.\n\"It doesn't come to light unless somebody makes political or commercial use of the information,\" said Paul Rothstein, a law professor at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington.\nYet experts agree the law is broken frequently -- possibly hundreds or thousands of times a day -- given the availability and use of scanners that can tune in wireless calls. It's estimated that anywhere from 10 million to 20 million scanners are in use nationwide, many able to eavesdrop on cellular calls.\n\"While the cellular industry may give their customers the illusion of privacy by assuring customers that it is illegal to listen, and that cellular-capable scanners are no longer manufactured or imported into the United States, millions of Americans do listen in,\" according to Bob Grove, publisher of Monitoring Times Magazine.\nLast week, the FBI opened an investigation into the taping and leaking of a telephone conference call between Gingrich and his top lieutenants. The probe came after a Florida couple said they  delivered a tape of the cellular phone conversation to the senior Democrat on the House Ethics Committee.\nA transcript of the tape was published in two newspapers two days later, prompting Republican calls for an FBI criminal probe into the source of the leak.\n\"You're not going to see the law enforced unless it involves a person of rank, such as a politician,\" said Linus Layne Baker, a Kansas City, Mo. attorney who was fined in the Texas case. \"You won't see the media prosecuted either.\"\nOne option under study in wake of the Gingrich incident is whether to beef up a law that outlaws the sale, manufacture or imporation of scanners capable of picking up cellular calls.",

Monopolies control more than 90 percent of the non-U.S. market.\nU.S. phone companies, as a result, paid their overseas counterparts $5.5 billion more in 1995 than foreign companies paid U.S. carriers to complete calls.\n\"This figure would drop in half overnight if American carriers simply paid fees even vaguely related to costs,\" FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said in a recent speech. He noted that the imbalance dwarfs the U.S. foreign aid budget of $2 billion.\nWhile the accounting rates paid by both carriers are about equal, the imbalance reflects the fact that many more overseas calls are made from the United States than into this country.\nThe United States has big imbalances with China, Jamaica, Mexico, Hong Kong, Columbia and Argentina, among others.\n\"Those few countries trying to defend their monopolies are going to be nervous\" about the FCC effort, said Dan Rosen of the Institute for International Economics.\nU.S. carriers support the strategy.\n\"You've got to move accounting rates to cost,\" said AT&T Corp. Vice President Gerry Salemme. AT&T said it must pay 45 cents a minute to have its calls connected to the Dominican Republic, but that the actual cost is 7 to 8 cents a minute.\nThe FCC actions come as the United States is seeking to open overseas telecommunications markets through talks sponsored by the World Trade Organisation.\nTo cut rates and open markets, the FCC is adopting a carrot-and-stick approach. Tuesday's order is meant for open markets, such as possibly Britain, Canada and Chile.\nThe FCC will waive its \"proportionate return\" rules that limit the ability of U.S. and foreign carriers to negotiate lower rates for overseas calls. To win a waiver, a foreign carrier's home market must be open to competition.\nThe existing rules require overseas companies to turn over their long-distance calls to U.S. carriers in the same proportion U.S. carriers send calls to a foreign carrier's home market.\nIf AT&T, for example, accounts for 60 percent of calls to a country, then that country's monopoly must hand off 60 percent of its U.S.-bound calls to AT&T.\nThe FCC proposal due next month would set \"benchmark\" rates for what U.S. carriers could pay foreign carriers to complete calls. These rates, according to FCC officials, would better reflect actual costs.\nThe agency must still work out the details of how long a country would have to lower its rates and what steps could be taken if it refused to do so.\n\"It literally has the potential of saving consumers billions of dollars,\" said Scott Harris, an attorney with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.\nBut the plan could rub governments the wrong way. High rates charged by their own phone monopolies can be used to maintain bloated payrolls or to subsidise local phone service.",

He noted the FCC's success last year in having Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens lift a lower court stay that had blocked a major FCC airwave auction.\nBut others were less sure. \"It's very difficult to predict,\" said Nicholas Allard of Latham & Watkins.\nThe Justice Department request, along with those of the long-distance companies, is expected to go to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who oversees matters related to the St. Louis-based appeals court.\nThomas could refer the request to the full court for its consideration.",

Cable-TV rates jumped 7.8 percent last year, more than double the 3.3 percent rise in consumer prices.  \nResidential interstate long-distance rates rose 3.7 percent, while intrastate long-distance rates jumped 6.1 percent.\nGore noted, however, that the increases in cable-TV rates are not a result of the new law and that they come within the guidelines established by a major 1992 cable-TV law.\nMeanwhile, big cable-TV operators such as Time Warner Inc and Tele-Communications Inc have watered down plans to offer phone and other services and are instead defending their own turf.  \nGore said he was \"surprised\" by those decisions, but added that it has not been universal among all cable companies.\n\"I rather suspect the pioneers who make these investments will be handsomely rewarded by the market,\" Gore said. That, in turn, should spur other cable companies to take the plunge and diversify their offerings.\nMeanwhile, Gore aide Greg Simon told reporters that the administration is sticking by its proposal for an expedited auction of analog spectrum that will be returned by television broadcasters during the transition to digital TV.\nUnder the administration plan, the government would auction the spectrum in 2002, with digital TV stations required to return their analog channel to the government no later than 2005.",

        "Text": "The Federal Communications Commission is expected to curb its power to approve or reject long-distance rates by ending a Depression-era rule requiring telephone carriers to notify the FCC before rate changes.\nThe new rules, set to be adopted on Tuesday, are meant to pump more competition into the $70 billion long-distance market and trim government red tape for AT&T Corp, MCI Communications Corp, Sprint Corp and other long-distance carriers, said FCC officials.  \nThe 1934 rule that is headed for the scrap heap has forced long-distance companies to notify the FCC in advance of plans to change rates or offer new services through \"tariff\" filings with the agency.\nIt was intended originally to let regulators review the changes while giving the public an advance look, although the language contained in the filings is arcane and read by few.\nRegulators say the new approach will let companies respond more quickly to competitors' price changes -- without the need to file burdensome paperwork with the FCC.  \nThey also say it will reduce the opportunity for companies to collude tacitly on long-distance rates.\nAnd carriers will have to notify residential customers directly of a rate change. Currently, they unveil any rate increases through the complex tariff filings.\nThe new approach represents the first major step the FCC has taken under a provision of the new telecommunications law allowing it to shed outdated rules if the public interest is not harmed.\nCurrently, tariff filings take effect one day after their submission to the FCC. But it has not always been that way.  \nWhen it was considered a \"dominant\" long-distance carrier, AT&T complained that the filings offered competitors an early look at its plans, allowing the others to mimic the move and implement it beforehand.\nThe top long-distance company had to wait up to 60 days after a tariff filing for a new promotional plan before it could act on the plan. A year ago, the FCC ended AT&T's dominant carrier status. That also ended the long delays.  \nThe FCC tried to eliminate long-distance tariff filings for \"non-dominant\" carriers such as MCI and Sprint about a dozen years ago. But a court said the agency lacked the power to do so. The FCC then asked Congress to change the law.\nIndustry officials have sought -- but apparently without success -- to retain the option of filing tariffs for certain residential telephone plans, saying that would make it easier to let consumers know what their phone rates are.\n\"We think there ought to be something in place for the mass marketplace,\" said an AT&T spokesman.  \nHe added that tariff filings allow residential customers to know the terms and conditions of their service. And he said they save the company the expense of having to communicate those terms and conditions to individual customers.\nBut critics complain that such a practice would make it tougher for consumers to know when a rate rise was coming, because it would be buried in the jargon of the tariff filing.\nOfficials do favor ending tariff filings for big business customers, paperwork that can run hundreds of pages. Ending the practice, they say, would give carriers added flexibility to negotiate the best deals with big customers.\nBusiness users agree.\n\"It allows for individual customers to negotiate the best terms and conditions for them, while preserving the normal customer-supplier confidentiality we see in other contracts,\" said Ray Cline, director of information systems for the American Petroluem Institute, an oil industry trade group.",

For instance, it would hold them liable if they made projections about future results and they turned out to be wrong.\nOpponents of the measure fear that corporate officers would stop making any projections about how their business was doing, making it more difficult to make investment decisions and leading to a decline in share prices.\nProponents argue it will help victims of fraud recover losses. Opponents charge it is an \"insidious\" bid by securities lawyers to line their own pockets.\nThere were signs the campaign against 211 could affect the outcome. A Los Angeles Times poll published Friday found 52 percent of likely voters now oppose it, up 10 percentage points from a similar Times poll five weeks ago.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt has urged California voters to reject the measure, warning it would use the state's legal system to roll back the federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act passed last year.\n\"California state courts could become a magnet for class action suits,\" he wrote in a letter of opposition.\nBoth President Bill Clinton and Republican presidential rival Bob Dole have come out against the measure and a recent study said its passage could result in a loss of up to 1.8 million jobs and a $102 billion drop in U.S. domestic output.\nThe study, by trade economist Clyde Prestowitz, also projected a subsequent rise in \"frivolous lawsuits\" could result in as much as a 24 percent drop in stock market prices.\nThis, he concluded, \"would far outweigh the 4 cents per dollar compensation, or less, that shareholders would receive from settlements and judgments\" under the measure.\nHigh-tech companies are considered more vulnerable to shareholder suits because their stocks typically are owned by demanding investors seeking fastest-growing companies, which can make their stock prices more volatile.\nA recent survey by the American Electronics Association of its members found nearly half would consider leaving the state if 211 passes. Some economists estimated it would eliminate 150,000 jobs and cost $1.3 billion in California alone.\nEven companies outside California, like International Business Machines Corp. and software giant Microsoft Corp. have opposed the measure, concerned that a single California shareholder could bring suit against them.\nIf it passes, high tech leaders like venture capitalist John Doerr, who is leading the $30 million-plus battle against 211, and Cypress Semiconductor Chief Executive T.J. Rodgers, have said they expect outside company directors to quit.\n\"If it passes, my net worth, my house, will be on the line,\" Rodgers said at a recent public debate on the issue here. \"It's a sleazy trick,\" he added.\nProponents of 211, including lawyers who bring shareholder lawsuits and stand to benefit directly from it, said they drew up the measure after a business-led initiative in the spring was opposed by nearly 60 percent of California voters.\n\"Americans are disgusted by corporate greed,\" said Richard Alexander, an attorney speaking in favour of the measure recently. \"People are angry about massive layoffs.\"\nBut in Northern California, where high tech businesses have thrived, executives said the proposition was more geared to forcing corporations to settle shareholder suits up front.",

He founded the business with a childhood friend in Santa Cruz in 1980, using a used juicing machine in a shed behind their house.\nOdwalla has grown by more than 40 percent a year, with annual sales in its fiscal year to Aug. 31, 1996, surging 65 percent to $59.2 million. It is now estimated to account for more than 70 percent of the fresh-juice market in the seven Western states it serves, together with Vancouver, British Columbia.\nThe company prides itself on using cold processing, which it says leaves vegetable and other biological nutrients intact, and on a rapid store distribution system. Its marketing emphasizes freshness and the absence of pasteurization and artificial additives or preservatives.\nEven its name, from a song poem by the Art Ensemble of Chicago jazz group, displays a sense of mission. The Odwalla is a leader who guided the \"lost people of the sun\" out of the \"gray haze\" -- of \"overprocessed foods\" in this case.\nSteltenpohl and Chief Executive Officer Stephen Williamson said Odwalla had mobilized its 175 trucks and drivers, armed with hand-held computers, to recover recalled bottles from the shelves of more than 4,600 outlets in California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas and Vancouver.\nExecutives immediately offered to refund the purchase price of any of the company's drinks, even those not among the 16 out of 23 fruit varieties recalled. They also said the company would pay for medical treatment for anyone found to have become ill through drinking an Odwalla product.\nAlthough Williamson said the company had product liability insurance that he believed would cover the incident, the executives declined to answer questions about the financial impact of the recall and any subsequent actions.\nOdwalla shares were up $1.13 at $13.25 by Friday afternoon after shedding roughly a third of their value on Thursday.\nJean-Michel Valette, an analyst at Hambrecht & Quist, said publicity surrounding the recall would hurt sales but with insurance and $14 million in cash, \"Odwalla has the resources to weather the storm.\"\nOdwalla, which takes the precaution of keeping samples of each batch of juice it produces, is working with the Food and Drug Administration and Washington state authorities to determine how contamination might have occurred and how widespread it was.\nBut company officials said it was too soon to question their philosophy.",

Servers are computers that manage the flow of data in a network.\nThis latter feature is provided by new Lotus technology dubbed Domino, which is currently being tested.\nZisman said too much attention was now devoted to browsers, software that lets users help navigate the Internet.\n\"The browser market is being eclipsed by the server market today as we speak,\" he said, noting browsers will most likely be offered as part of the operating system, as with Windows.\n\"The action, I believe, is going to be in the server market,\" he said, adding that server software for collaboration through Internet sites alone is projected to be a $1 billion market by the end of the decade.\nThe market for servers at the hub of Web sites will likely segment into at least three distinct classes -- content, collaboration and commerce -- and larger organisations will likely mix \"best of breed\" applications from different suppliers, he said.\nLotus Development is concentrating helping people work together electronically, he said, because \"content without collaboration is useless ... the value is not in the content.\"\nHe noted as an example Web sites which not only carried information, but enabled people to communicate interactively with the Web site or other individuals using the Internet.\n\"The borders are blurry. I don't believe that we will see pure content sites and I don't believe that we will see pure commerce sites,\" he said. \"We will obtain and retain customers if we engage them.\"",

The real problem is: When is it that they have information that I care about?\" said Eli Barkat, chief executive of BackWeb Technologies, a San Jose, Calif.-based start-up.\n\"What people want is to build relationships,\" he said.\nVivek Ranadive, president of Reuters Holdings Plc's Tibco Inc. unit, likens the initial enthusiasm for surfing the Net to Sunday drives in the early days of the automobile, a pleasant but passing phenomenon.\nElectronic commerce over the Internet, which is expected to gather steam in 1997, requires a more efficient way of navigating the information superhighway, executives say.\nMore than a dozen companies, mostly small high-tech start-ups, have been busily seeking to define the space, much as search engines like Yahoo Inc., Infoseek Corp., Excite Inc. and Lycos Inc. have done in helping people search out what they want.\n\"As it was for search engines six months or a year ago, this is an area that has been more or less discovered by venture capitalists and others as something that has to be dealt with,\" said Jack Wilson, managing editor of Technologic Partners' ComputerLetter.\nIn addition to the impracticality of aiming to find real-time information in the more than 50 million Web pages that search engines catalog, many companies would like to be able to update customers and suppliers directly.\n\"There are some obvious problems with today's browse-and-pull technique for getting at information when you need it,\" Wilson said. \"So there is a proliferation of new companies and new products from old companies aimed at solving this.\"\nMore than a dozen companies are now vying for attention, including Ex Machina, which is providing a wireless news alerting system made by Global Village Communication Inc., and New York City-based Ifusion Com.\nSo far, the category has been dominated by one pioneering entry, Cupertino, Calif.-based PointCast Network, which burst onto the scene in the spring with a screen saver display which offers customized and updated news, data and advertising.\n\"The biggest application that's got the visibility with this type of technology is PointCast,\" said Phil White, chief executive of Informix Software Inc.. \"PointCast has got everybody now aware of how I can subscribe to things.\"\nAnother hot Silicon Valley start-up in the sector is Marimba Inc., founded by Kim Polese and three colleagues from the Sun Microsystems Inc. team which created the popular new Java programming language.\nIndustry executives say competition is vital to expanding the marketplace, but it also creates confusion as companies vie for a share of the action.\n\"I think there's a lot of confusion in the market,\" said Barkat. \"You hear a lot of names when people talk about this space, and the reason is the space is huge.\"\nTechnologies that transform the way information is delivered on the Web, such as those which Tibco Inc. will announce Monday, may help expand the market, according to industry analysts and executives.\n\"We are essentially a plumbing company, so we do plumbing software, and people like Marimba and BackWeb and PointCast can actually make use of our software,\" said Ranadive.\n\"Now the technology they presently use to do this is a pull technology and so you can emulate a push by going out and asking a lot of questions,\" he added. \"But you're tying up the network, you're tying up the server by doing that.\"",

A fully configured system, which includes memory, a keyboard, a mouse and fourteen-inch monitor will ship for $995.  \nSun officials are hoping the device will appeal to corporate clients looking to cut their costs for upgrading and maintaining office PC's.\nHowever, given the entry of long-time NC doubter Microsoft Corp into the market with plans for a light version of its Windows operating system, the market will be hotly contested.\nInternational Business Machines Corp launched its first NC model last month.  \nRedwood City, Calif.-based Oracle Corp, which has been beating the drum for creating a new NC standard for 18 months, is leading a further effort to build network computers for broader markets.\n\"This is just beginning to heat up and could potentially start getting very interesting,\" one analyst said of the brewing slugfest between computer industry titans.\nSun Microsystems's machines are more highly targeted than many of its adversaries', however, and it has linked them together with a Java-centric model of future computing.  \nJava, a hot new technology introduced by Sun in May 1995 as a programming language initially, has since been expanded into a whole computing architecture for both hardware and software as Sun moved aggressively to proliferate its use.\nSun has licensed Java to the suppliers of nearly all major computer operating systems, including Microsoft and its popular Windows operating systems. One of Java's most compelling features is that it can be used across rival systems.  \nThis feature should enable software developers in the future to write one version of their software that could work on nearly all systems, known as \"write once, play anywhere.\"\nInitially, the market will be to replace very basic computer terminals, such as IBM's 3270 terminals or IBM AS/400 midrange character-based terminals, in very simple, dedicated functions such as entering data into a company's network.\nInternational Data Corp projects there are \"a couple of million\" such terminals in use currently, and perhaps as many as 10 million personal computers used for such activities.  \nThe market for the NC is likely to build sales gradually, according to IDC, which expects a million to be sold around the world in 1997, still dwarfed by the tens of millions of personal computers sold annually.\nSome industry analysts have questioned whether the NC will ever really catch on, and many believe it will not do so for at least some 18 months or so, by which time Sun's partners should be producing microprocessors optimized for Java.\nEd Zander, president of Sun Microsystems Computer Company, said in an interview that Sun realistically expects acceptance to be a gradual process, but to lead to a new computing epoch.\n\"We worked long and hard about not just producing a cheap box, but (also addressing the question) 'How does that box work in a corporate environment?',\" he said. \"'How do you administer it? How do manage it? How do you develop it? How do you deploy it?'\"\nHe acknowledges Sun's approach produced a system that is \"markedly different\" from the NCs that Oracle and IBM are talking about, or even that of Microsoft's NetPC.\nSun is targeting cost savings, claiming large organizations can reduce the three-year cost of ownership using its Java systems to around $7,500, or as much as one fifth of three-year networkedPC costs projected at up to $36,000.",

Good deals are being made across the country in all industries.\nCompanies in the startup and early stages attracted the greatest level of venture capital investment, the study found, with these comprising 46 percent of the 444 companies receiving funds and accounting for $600 million invested.\nOn average startup companies received more than $3.1 million in funding and, communications firms accounted for nearly 56 percent of the total invested in this category.\nFunding for Internet-related companie continued at the high level set in the second quarter of 1996, with 62 Internet- related companies receiving funding in the quarter exeeding the year-ago period by six times.\nIn a new trend, third quarter venture investment activity appeared to expand beyond the traditionally dominant Silicon Valley and New England areas, whose combined share of investment fell to 33 percent of value invested.\nTypically the two regions account for some 40 to 45 percent of the total amount invested by venture funds, and experts said it confirms atriend towards more even distribution.\n\"Nobody in Silicon Valley is going to panic,\" because of the increase in funding outside the key areas, Walden said.",

        "Text": "An outspoken computer security expert, citing his just-completed study, says up to two-thirds of certain Web sites, including reputable institutions like banks and the media, are vulnerable to hacker attacks.\nDan Farmer -- who stirred controversy in 1995 as co-author of software dubbed SATAN that enables people with basic skills to infiltrate computer systems -- surveyed more than 2,200 Web sites.\nThe survey released last week covered a relatively small portion of the sprawling Web but focused on sites where security is more of a concern.\nFarmer probed 660 bank sites around the globe, 312 North American online newspaper sites, 274 credit union sites, 47 U.S. federal government sites and 451 Internet sex clubs.\nIn a summary, Farmer said that, out of his sample of about 1,700 Web sites he selected, \"over 60 percent could be broken into or destroyed.\" As a control, he probed a random sample of 469 sites.\nFarmer said he used relatively crude, non-intrusive methods and did not actually break into the sites. He also said he would not publish the names of the sites he surveyed.\n\"I barely electronically breathed on these (computer) hosts,\" he said in his report, adding that, considering more intrusive tests, some 70 percent to 80 percent of sites may have security flaws.\nOther computer security experts found Farmer's results credible and authoritative, David Kennedy, director of research, education and consulting at the National Computer Security Association, said in a telephone interview Monday.\nExperts and computer industry executives said the study shed more light on a problem well known within the industry but insufficiently understood by the public at large.\nThe threat of hacker attacks was highlighted earlier this year when intruders broke into the Justice Department and Central Intelligence Agency Web sites and altered them, prompting the CIA to close its site temporarily.\nFarmer stressed that Web sites are being used primarily for marketing and advertising purposes and that, although some bank sites may allow visitors to look up balances, the sites do not provide access to internal financial systems.\nDeborah Triant, president of CheckPoint Software Technologies Ltd.'s U.S. operating unit in Redwood City, Calif., said banks routinely keep Web sites on separate computer systems.\n\"Our experience is the banks are so paranoid that they won't even allow the access that they should be able to allow and would be quite safe if you had a modern firewall\" protecting their networks from intruders, said Triant, whose company is the market leader in firewall technology.\n\"So, if their Web site is vulnerable, that doesn't mean that anything else at the bank is vulnerable, or that their customers' accounts or the transactions their customers are doing are vulnerable,\" she said.\nNevertheless, with the advent of electronic commerce over the Internet expected to gain momentum in 1997, lax security remains a critical issue, experts said.\nFarmer separated security flaws into two categories -- a red category where he said a site was \"essentially wide open to any potential attacker\" and a yellow category deemed less serious but with potential for disastrous consequences.\nOf the 660 bank sites, 68 percent were deemed vulnerable and nearly 36 percent were in the red category.\nSome 51 percent of credit unions were vulnerable, 62 percent of the federal sites, nearly 70 percent of newpapers and 66 percent of sex clubs. Sites in the red category ranged from 20 percent for credit unions to 38 percent for federal sites and 39 percent for online newspapers.\nOf the random sample of 469 Web sites used as the control, a far smaller percentage -- 33 percent -- were found to be vulnerable, and 17 percent of the group was in the red category.\nFarmer said part of the problem is that Web sites are trying to do too much at once, increasing their complexity and making security far more difficult to achieve.\nBut, even with security concerns, credit card transactions over the Net are much safer than those carried out in shopping malls, said the security association's Kennedy.\nFarmer also said he plans to incorporate some newer testing tools into a new version of SATAN, which stands for Security Administrator Tool for Analysing Networks, early next year.\nThe programme enables people who manage corporate networks to locate weaknesses and fix them. But it has been controversial because it can also easily be used by malevolent intruders trying to cause damage.\nTriant said there have been no reported security breaches at any of the more than 15,000 institutions with CheckPoint network security installed and said such precautions should provide adequate protection.",

Chief Executive Andy Grove, who under the theme \"A Revolution in Progress,\" will trace the history of the microprocessor which turned Intel from a fledgling chip company into the world's largest semiconductor company.\nGrove will also provide live demonstrations of how personal computers can already be used for sophisticated applications today for complex graphics displays. He will outline goals and challenges facing the PC industry over the next 15 years, with projections for the next quarter century.\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Bill Gates promises to issue a challenge to the industry in a keynote speech whose title harkens back to Gates' \"Information at Your Fingertips\" address here six years ago.\nGates, who recently republished his book, \"The Road Ahead,\" in paperback, has said the industry is too optimistic about what it can produce within a short, two-year time frame, but far too pessimistic about what can be achieved in a decade.\nNetscape Communications Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jim Barkesdale on Wednesday will make the third of a trio of keynotes that day, providing insight on how the pioneer of Web browsers sees competition moving to internal corporate networks based on Internet technology, known as intranets.\nBut the celebrations begin already on Sunday night, as International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus Development Corp. officially launches its SmartSuite 97 for Windows 95 and Windows NT at a lavish gathering to be followed by IBM's famous Toga Party.\nMicrosoft Corp. is due to unveil the Handheld PC (HPC) devices running its Windows CE consumer electronics version of its system at a Treasure Island Hotel bash complete with a Cirque du Soleil performance.\nA handful of major computer companies, including Compaq Computer Corp., NEC Corp. and Hitachi Ltd., are due to unveil mobile Windows CE-based handheld devices.\nOn Monday, Microsoft is due to show off the master version of its lastest productivity suite Office 97, enabling a direct comparison between its offering and Smartsuite 97.\nApple Computer Inc., still seeking to recover from huge losses over the last year, is expected to counter the Windows CE launch with more industry-focused adaptations of its three-year-old Newton handheld technology.\nThe company may also seize the opportunity to provide more details of its future technology plans, as rumours continue to swirl over discussions it has had with startup Be Inc., which has been working on a speedy new operating system.",

The stock was one of the most actively traded on the exchange.\nThe stock of the Mountain View, Calif.-based company has lost more than a quarter of its value since the end of 1996, including a drop of around 19 percent after another analysts' warning last Wednesday.\nSmith said he remained neutral on the stock but cited industry sources as saying Netscape had scrambled to meet its fourth-quarter numbers at the end of 1996, which he said did not bode well for its current quarter and all of 1997.\n\"They closed a significant amount of business on Dec. 31 just to make the quarter, which they've never had to do before,\" he said.

But it is also likely to be marked by frequent communications breakdowns caused, in part, by increased demand.\n\"I wrote a year ago about a collapse, but it's really collapses, getting more frequent, deeper and longer,\" said Robert Metcalfe, inventor of Ethernet computer networking technology and founder of 3Com Corp who is now vice president of technology at International Data Group of Boston.\nMetcalfe said the congestion that causes many people to call the World Wide Web the \"World Wide Wait\" is only one of many problems that can prompt it to crash. Major outages have been caused by such seemingly minor events as a rodent chewing a power cable or an ampersand typed in the wrong place in software on central Internet devices.\nThis summer, more than 6 million customers of America Online Inc., the world's largest online computer service, were without service for 19 hours because of a software problem. In October, a failure at Internet service provider BBN Corp's Stanford University Internet facility cut off access for 400 top high tech firms for nearly a day.\nExperts such as Metcalfe predict similar types of outages next year as telecommunications companies and Internet providers struggle to keep up with demand. Still, Web surfers are likely to see many new features in 1997, from advanced graphics to slick ways to communicate with each other using animated characters in virtual chat rooms and high-tech games.\nDozens of companies, including Germany-based Black Sun Interactive, which recently opened an operation in San Francisco, have been developing new virtual worlds based on a technology called Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML).\nThe technology, pronounced \"ver-mul,\" enables creators of multi-player computer games, for example, to design lifelike characters and three-dimensional settings that will exploit new 3-D computer chip designs and speeded-up microprocessors with added multimedia features due next year. New capabilities include interactive three-dimensional fly-over cities created by the startup Bigbook, which allows users to swoop down on a building and click on it with a mouse to see who is inside.\nBut as the Net becomes more lifelike, the prospects for a showdown between regulators and free-speech advocates over the issue of online pornography is likely to increase. In October, the FBI said it was investigating an electronic mail message sent to thousands of Internet users offering child pornography for sale.\nThe question of whether to regulate the content of the Internet, both within a country's borders and internationally, comes as officials in Washington are pressing for reductions in sexual and violent content in film and television. One solution offered by some software firms is a device like television's V-chip, which allows parents to restrict access to certain programmes.\nNext year will also see new electronic communities in which people can participate as consumer, customer, contributor or even investor in enterprises over the Web.\nAlthough 1997 will not be the year people rush out to do all their shopping on line, it will be a critical year for deploying the technologies that will make electronic commerce widely available in 1998 and 1999, according to analysts.\nMichael Parekh, Internet analyst at Goldman Sachs, expects companies to continue using Internet technology both in internal networks, known as Intranets, and to create what are known as Extranets, to reach customers and suppliers.\n\"The big thing for 1997 is going to be the way users think of the Web goes from a pull paradigm to a push paradigm,\" he said, referring to the goal of being able to send data to individuals rather than waiting for them to seek it.\nIn the United States, only about one third of the country's 97 million households have a personal computer and just 11 percent of U.S. households are estimated to have the modem devices necessary to link them to the Internet.\nFaster, 56-kilobit modems are due next year, but analysts expect a battle over standards will slow their spread.",

This compares with its earlier plan to raise $76 million from sale of 6.3 million shares.\nIPO analysts said the company was wise to hold off on its initial offering, enabling it to take advantage of the current pickup in new share offerings coming to market.\nSome Internet analysts also said the offering faces a market that is becoming more discerning than in the past, when investors snapped up shares of companies which had minimal operating history and little promise of near-term profits.\n\"I think they're going to have a little bit of a challenge with this one. It's just fundamentals,\" said one analyst. \"A couple of years ago, when the Internet was just starting, you could have taken your dog named 'Net' public.\"\nMany investors and analysts compare Wired with traditional print media, since some 90 percent of its revenues are still derived from its high-tech monthly, which since 1993 has been promoted as the magazine of the digital revolution.\nEarly investors in Wired have included high tech guru Nicholas Negroponte, who heads the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Labs, and publisher S.I. Newhouse.\nWired continues to be among the fastest-growing publishing properties, growing in circulation from 90,000 at the end of 1993, its first year of publication, to an estimated 325,000 in August, according to the company's offering documents.\nThe company also runs HotWired, a hip Web site geared for those who want to keep on the leading edge of digital developments, and the search engine HotBot.\nBut IPO experts note the business plan for the Internet operations was still in early development and the company continues to post heavy losses, with a net loss for the first six months of 1996 of $34.7 million, including a $20.5 million writeoff, more than double its revenues of $15.63 million.\nAt an expected price of some 7.3 times estimated 1996 revenues, the valuation would be cheaper than recent Internet content companies like CNET Inc., which has traded at 20 times 1996 revenues, or Yahoo! Inc., which has been trading at more than 40 times estimated 1996 revenues.\nBut this is pricey compared to more conventional print media valuations, where two times revenues is often the norm, and four to five times for properties exhibiting strong growth in an otherwise maturing sector, analysts said.\n\"Wired changed journalism, especially high-tech journalism, and made it cool,\" said Harmon, adding that investors may have difficulty valuing this in financial terms.\n\"I think Wired expected everybody to just assume it was the emperor emeritus of the digital world and that everything they did turned to gold,\" he said.",

Earlier, it closed up $1.625 at $123.875 on the Nasdaq market.\n\"I think it's an overall positive for stocks tomorrow,\" said Charles Boucher, semiconductor analyst at UBS Securities.\n\"The Street got possibly a little better than they were looking for, so I think you've got a chance to add on to this rally tomorrow,\" he said. \"The danger here is in investors getting too enthusiastic about the size of this number.\"\nSeparately, the trade group said it was planning to phase out the North American semiconductor index and replace it with a global index that would help industry watchers keep better track of demand for computer chips.\nThe industry group said it was making the change because the current figure only tracks sales and orders in the Americas, representing only a third of the total world market, and provided disproportionate data on certain chip sectors.\nWhile both industry and analysts have criticized the wide fluctuations and frequent revisions in the data -- even the September number was revised to 0.98 from 0.99 -- the move taken by industry consensus met with mixed reviews.\n\"I think it's a good idea,\" said Intel spokesman Howard High. \"The book-to-bill hasn't really reflected the true health of the industry, good or bad, for quite a while.\"\n\"As the business turned very global in its nature, the book-to-bill flash report was a U.S.-based number,\" he said. \"If you take it to the global market, it's really not done the job that people have been using it for.\"\nBut some analysts said the decision to drop aggregate bookings data altogether would only increase the amount of market uncertainty, as investors would have to rely on far more speculative estimates of new orders.\n\"I think it's going to blow up in their face,\" one top analyst said. \"It's going to be a lot more speculative. We're all going to be trying to do the analysis but we're going to be doing it based on our own independent surveys.\"\nKey semiconductor makers had argued, however, that bookings data was imprecise and subject to varying inventory strategies of distributors without any uniform reporting methods.",

        "Text": "A fast-selling product that allows grannies all across America to exchange electronic mail securely with their families may become a key weapon in challenging the U.S. government's tight encryption policies.\nComputer industry executives said the strong encryption which startup USWeb Networks is delivering on hundreds of thousands of television-based Internet browsing devices is still prohibited from export by U.S. Cold War munitions laws.\nExecutives at Palo Alto, Calif.-based WebTV said they chose to use the strongest coding standard available to give consumers the assurance their communications would be kept confidential.\n\"The only way we felt we could guarantee the level of security we felt was uncrackable by anyone...was if we were essentially using CIA-class security procedures,\" said Steve Perlman, co-founder and chief executive of WebTV Networks.\nWebTV uses 128-bit encryption, based on coded 'keys' with 128 characters of information, the same level of coding used in some of the most secretive U.S. government communications.\n\"It's very similar to what they use when they're communicating with cruise missiles,\" Perlman said.\nThis is a useful fact to point out in reassuring potential customers they can both communicate and pay for goods and services securely over the Internet, he added.\n\"They love it. They really love it, beause now they can just relax and forget about it,\" he said. Using a credit card number over WebTV's encrypted communications is safer than reading it over a telephone, which can be tapped, he argues.\n\"While the FBI can get your credit card that way (over the telephone), they can't get it through WebTV,\" he said.\nPerhaps equally excited about the decision by WebTV to use such strong encryption is the Silicon Valley high tech business community, which has been deadlocked in a battle with the Clinton administration over encryption restrictions.\nLaws against the export of encryption date back to the start of the Cold War, when earlier versions of coding were considered vital to national security and were classified as munitions explicitly barred from export.\nTop computer executives now say the use of encryption in relatively normal, consumer-oriented applications such as WebTV is a perfect example why they feel the government's efforts to restrict the technology should ultimately fail.\n\"Without commenting specifically on WebTV, I can tell you that the government is fighting essentially a losing battle here,\" said Eric Schmidt, chief technology officer at Sun Microsystems Inc.\n\"What's happened is that the technology is now so ubiquitous and there are so many people using it that the current law...really needs to be scrapped.\"\nIn addition to the need for U.S. businesses to have strong encryption to secure their own systems when operating overseas, the computer industry argues that competitors in other countries are being given an open market to sell higher levels of encryption U.S. companies are barred from selling.\nBut Washington insists that law enforcement authorities must have a means of breaking into encoded messages to investigate criminal activity.\nThe Administration recently offered a compromise where companies could export modestly strong 'keys,' less powerful than those used by WebTV, as long as they could be recovered by authorities to crack codes after obtaining a court warrant.\nIndustry is not pleased with the idea.\nIt would be difficult, and unduly expensive, to administer and is unlikely to be acceptable to foreign customers who might not consider the U.S. government to have a right to break into their confidential communications, many argue.\n\"Our personal view is that the notion of key recovery is something that's not going to be very acceptable, particularly to other countries -- the notion that the U.S. government would be able to recover the keys,\" said Deborah Triant, chief executive of Check Point Software Technologies, Inc.\nIn the meantime, however, WebTV will be prohibited except by special license from exporting its devices, which are being sold by consumer electronics manufacturers Sony Corp. and Philips Electronics NV through retail stores.\nIn fact, the issue came to light publicly following a letter from one of the manufacturers to its distributors, warning not to export the machines due to the munitions laws.\n\"It would definitely be unfortunate if sombedy was to carry one over the border,\" said Perlman, adding the WebTV boxes have more computing power than the world's most powerful supercomputer -- Cray Reasearch's XMP-48 -- did in 1987.\n\"That was a $50 million computer in 1987. This is a $300 computer and it outperforms the Cray,\" he said.\nWebTV has attracted investments from Microsoft Corp. and a unit of US West Inc..\n\"This WebTV is the first of many we're going to see where legitimate customers really do need very strong encryption for things involving really normal day-to-day use,\" said Schmidt.",

All of a sudden they (the hedge funds) knew they were in trouble,\" one head trader said.\nClearly, it was the foreign funds, not the local punters, who got caught out.\n\"This news was in the market the whole week with certain people,\" said the head trader at one local house. \"I knew there was a massive short position in the market and after the first minute of trading, I wasn't at all surprised by what happened.\"\nNow that the dust has settled, fund managers are offering routine explanations for their near-term forecasts for the Hang Seng, all of them variations on the theme of a range-trade between 13,000 and 13,800.\nU.S. interest rates and upcoming corporate earnings are expected to dictate direction, but most market players are expecting consolidation at current levels.\nThere were few reports of so-called \"top-slicing,\" or rotation of funds into other markets, although traders did report profit-taking in Singapore and Indonesia, both of which fell over the course of the week after recent strength.\nSome funds said they had began cutting heavily overweight positions in Hong Kong when the Hang Seng hit 14,000 on January 16 and any further rotation is not justified given this week's strength.\nLast week's action also proved the independence of Asian stocks, which were either unchanged or weaker on domestic factors when the Deng news hit.\n\"They're all completely sucked into their own things,\" one trader said.\nAlthough individual factors helped push many indices lower through the region last week, traders and funds confirmed reports that institutional money was moving out of Asia and into Latin America.\n\"They can't find anything in Asia to buy,\" said one head trader. \"In Singapore and Malaysia, the earnings growth isn't massive and elsewhere it's not great. (Investors) expect better value in Latin America.\"\nOne foreign fund manager said the flows were understandable given that Latin America is trading at about 12 percent earnings growth on a multiple of 11.5 times - 20 percent below the average Asian earnings multiple.\n\"And Southeast Asia is still going through this adjustment,\" he said.\n\"Global asset allocators still look at Asia as a region suffering from cost overruns, squeezed margins and, in some industries, a lack of pricing power.\"",

        "Text": "Pegged currencies are common in Asia, with its fondness for order and authoritarianism.\nBut to peg one's currency is always a drastic step with heavy consequences. While a fixed exchange rate might reassure foreign investors about currency stability, it can also prompt a slew of unruly side effects.\n\"What you ultimately sacrifice is your control over inflation,\" said Alan Butler-Henderson, regional strategist with ING Barings in Hong Kong.\nHong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines, Singapore and China all peg their currencies directly or indirectly to the U.S. dollar, requiring all them to mimic U.S. monetary policy to a greater or lesser extent regardless of domestic conditions.\nMost of these economies bear no relation at all to the slow-growth, low-inflation United States. Instead, they are experiencing high growth and a rapid increase in domestic consumption at the same time -- an ideal recipe for inflation.\nThe lack of traditional inflation-fighting tools is a serious loss for countries anxious to avoid any erosion of often hard-earned economic progress.\nSERIOUS PENALTIES\nThere are other, serious penalties, too.\nA lucrative interest rate arbitrage can cause real problems for small Asian countries with fixed exchange rates. Best described as borrow low, lend high, the most common arbitrage tends to attract precisely the sort of capital inflows most small, Asian countries dread: so-called \"hot money.\"\nLarge financial institutions with access to the best international lending rates deposit borrowed funds into Asian banks offering much higher yields and, because of the fixed exchange rate, avoid currency loss when they switch out.\nHigher rates offer bigger returns, which attract even larger flows of hot money that swell money supply dramatically. Attempts by central banks to curb money supply by raising rates can have the reverse effect, luring in more hot, volatile money.\nBoth Thailand and Indonesia are familiar with this danger.\nOne economist noted that Indonesia has offered one of the best arbitrage opportunities in Asia for as long as it has depreciated its currency by between three and five percent annually, but the returns were particularly spectacular last year.\nSpeculators and hedge funds borrowed large sums in Japanese yen at about 0.75 percent annually and switched them into Indonesian bank accounts yielding 15 percent -- or more when riots swept through Jakarta in the summer.\n\"In terms of cost of funds, when you take the currency depreciation of the yen and the mild depreciation of the rupiah into account, you're paying nothing,\" the economist said.\nThe problem became so acute last year that Indonesia's central bank was forced to widen repeatedly the trading band for the rupiah, taking the market by surprise.\n\"The point of widening the fluctuation is to impart greater uncertainty so that it's not a freebie,\" said Sun Bae Kim, senior economist at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong.\nIndonesia also ordered its commercial banks to stop lending on occasion, even though soaring rates and strong loan demand offered excellent returns.\nTHE THAI EXPERIENCE\nThailand, which pegs its beleaguered baht to a basket of currencies including the U.S. dollar, tried to turn this arbitrage to its advantage by setting up the Bangkok International Banking Facility (BIBF) in 1993.\nThe plan, much admired by Asian experts, back-fired when Moody's Investors Service downgraded Thailand's short-term debt rating, drawing attention to its foreign liabilities.\nThe negative attention helped to fuel rampant speculation about a devaluation of the baht, forcing massive intervention by Thailand's central bank to keep the unit above a 6-1/2-year low.\nUnder the BIBF, a number of foreign and domestic banks were allowed to borrow foreign currency overseas, usually in U.S. dollars, and then lend the money in Thailand.\nThe scheme was a huge success. Foreign investors, already benefiting from competitive rates, also qualified for preferential tax treatment and rushed to invest in Thailand.\n\"Without those tax incentives and the access to cheap loans - U.S. dollars are by definition cheaper than Thailand (baht) - those companies would not be attracted to Thailand,\" said Clive McDonnell, chief economist at Crosby Group.\nBIBF flows were used primarily for long-term investment, but international accounting rules required that they be classifed as short-term. This generated a sudden explosion in Thailand's short-term external debt to 63.3 percent of private sector debt in 1995 compared with 20.5 percent in 1993 -- a situation that quickly came to Moody's attention.\nAsian economists defended the scheme while acknowledging its risks. Salomon Brothers noted that Thailand's foreign exchange reserves of US$38 billion far exceed outstanding short-term loans of US$16.1 billion.\nAnd Moody's rival, Standard and Poor's, pointed out that many BIBF loans are backed by foreign banks rather than domestic financial institutions.\n\"Foreign BIBFs are probably less vulnerable to shifts in investor confidence, because their parent banks are more likely to stand behind them should unaffiliated lenders withdraw their credit lines,\" Standard & Poor's said. \"Moreover, obligations of foreign-owned BIBFs are not a contingent liability of the Thai government, given their foreign ownership.\"\nThere is no question that the BIBF helped to lift foreign liabilities in Thailand's banking sector, but the underlying causes of the banks' asset quality problems were more commonly blamed on a weak property sector, economic recession, political turmoil and a gaping current account deficit.\nRecent attacks on the baht were precipitated by concern about how to finance the current account following projections of a fourth-quarter fiscal deficit.\nBut analysts said the foreign liability created by the BIBF will probably provide further motivation for the central bank to defend the currency. And a sustained defence will require action on those asset quality problems.\n\"This means shutting down insolvent institutions and building the capital base of viable ones. The longer the delay in formulating such a plan, the greater will be the baht's susceptibility to speculative attacks,\" Goldman Sachs said.",

        "Text": "Investing in Asian telecommunications stocks is full of hazards as the region grapples with a general lack of sophistication and wide discrepancies in demand and regulation, analysts say.\nViews differ greatly on the potential of individual stocks and countries, but analysts generally agree that telecom regulation is the most important determinant to future performance.\n\"Understanding the regulators is essential as regulatory issues were the main determinant of Asian telecom stock performance last year,\" Jardine Fleming said in a recent report.\nAsian telecom bulls say the global information revolution, combined with the region's rapid economic growth, have swamped the capacities of state-run operators, forcing a confrontation between regulators determined to meet demand and monopolistic state enterprises anxious to maintain market share.\n\"Asian telecom regulators, usually under-empowered, have promoted liberalisation, often taking on strong political and economic forces,\" Jardine Fleming said.\nSo far, regulators have responded by issuing licences -- a politics-fraught move that usually diminishes the prospects of the primary telecoms firm.\nThis is acceptable in low-penetration countries with untapped demand, analysts say, but more dicey in high-penetration markets, such as Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\"This is why deregulation in Hong Kong did not really make sense on the fixed-line side if the new licensees could not access the lucrative IDD sector, which they can,\" Jardine Fleming said.\nDEREGULATION DAMPENS OUTLOOK ON HK, SINGAPORE TELECOMS\nContinuing deregulation in Hong Kong and Singapore, two places with a high dependence on IDD traffic, has prompted a negative outlook on Singapore Telecom and Hongkong Telecom, it said.\nIn low-penetration countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines, regulators have issued concessions to build fixed lines, giving contractors the right to receive local revenues and perhaps a portion of those from domestic long distance.\nBecause the new local lines stimulate long-distance demand, this arrangement fails to attract the ire of primary telecoms which reap the benefit, analysts said.\nThis has worked well in Indonesia and the Philippines, where new local fixed lines are expected to boost earnings in both PT Telkom and Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT) rather than eroding their market position.\nThe situation is very different in the cellular sector, where major market players are complaining that too many licences have been issued as they lose market share to strong second-tier players which are aggressively undercutting tariffs.\nBecause of this primary/secondary interplay, Jardine Fleming said it has turned negative on Advanced Info Services Plc and neutral on Piltel. But it remained positive on Total Access Communications Plc.\nMalaysia's Technology Resources Industries Bhd has been battered down too hard, the brokerage believes, and it has been upgraded to a buy.\nBROKERAGE BULLISH ON INDONESIA, PHILIPPINES\nDeutsche Morgan Grenfell (DMG) is similarly optimistic on the outlook for PT Telkom and PLDT, but it adopts a much less optimistic overall view of Asia's telecom sector.\n\"The Asia-Pacific telecommunications industry is undergoing a period of rapid transition from a relatively underdeveloped and protected industry to one which is becoming increasingly saturated and highly competitive,\" DMG said in a recent report.\nAn overall increase in competitive pressures is not being made any easier by governments' liberal approach to the issue of licences and the lack of any industry consolidation, DMG said.\n\"In an environment of increasing saturation and rising competitive pressures, EPS (earnings per share) will continue to come under pressure,\" DMG said. \"We believe that we are already witnessing signs of industry maturity.\"\nDMG estimates that less than 10 percent of the population in the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia can afford telecom services.\nDMG is positive on Indonesia and South Korea, but for different reasons.\nIndonesia's lower telephone density combined with a restrictive and non-competitive regulatory structure are attractive, it said. In South Korea, a large middle class more than compensated for the higher number of phones.\n\"Although competitive pressures are rising, the combination of low, effective teledensity rates, a wide middle class and exceptionally aggressive capex and depreciation policy should ensure that Korea Mobile Telecom Co will continue to deliver above-average EPS growth rates,\" DMG said.\nEVEN TOUGHER TASKS AHEAD FOR REGULATORS\nAnalysts said regulators have done the easy part -- issuing new licences. Now it gets tricky as new licensees demand better terms on geography, interconnection and IDD rights. Cellular licensees are also demanding more spectrum.\n\"What will be interesting to watch is how quickly these number two companies demand that they compete on fair terms with the primary telecoms,\" Jardine Fleming said.",

If the United States raises short-term interest rates this year by one-quarter to one-half of a percentage point, as many expect, real rates in Hong Kong -- the difference between nominal rates and inflation -- will fall to about 1 percent, Chan said.\nSuch low rates will propel growing momentum in both private consumption and retail sales.\nChina, with its well-documented aversion to the socially destabilising effects of inflation, has done little to stoke further exuberance over Hong Kong's post-1997 economy beyond saying it backed Hong Kong's currency link.\n\"There seems little doubt Hong Kong's new sovereign wants to see the local economy prosper throughout the year of transition and in the early years of its resumption of sovereignty,\" Perkin wrote. \"It (is) probably true that it does not want to see the local economy going on a speculative spree that will eventually run out of steam and cause a collapse.\"",

Closing is expected before the end of the year.\nBoth Southern and CEPA said the takeover complements each other's strengths, with Southern renowned for its operating ability and CEPA one of the first to exploit Asia's quickening thirst for power.  \n\"This is, we felt, a very, very good marriage,\" said Stewart Elliott, CEPA's chief executive officer and managing director. \"If we're going to see Asian growth as everyone has predicted, a massive amount of power is required.\"\nFounded in 1993 as a holding company for Hopewell's power assets, CEPA owns some of southern China's largest power plants.\nIts flagship Shajiao B project in Guangdong province was completed in 1987 at a cost of US$4.1 billion followed by the 1994 start-up of the US$1.87 billion Shajiao C power station.  \nCEPA also owns substantial assets in the Philippines, and said it is negotiating to build more generating plants in southern China, the Philippines, Indonesia, India and Pakistan.\nHarris said Southern was committed to pursuing all CEPA's existing plans, which he hopes will be augmented by Southern's expertise and financial muscle.\n\"We are very optimistic about the future... We would hope we would have some announcements in relation to new power plants (in the next six to 12 months),\" Harris said.\nElliott and Gordon Wu, CEPA's executive chairman and the founder of Hopewell, will remain in place, he said.",

That is why you can only invest in Indonesian securities or new offerings,\" said Iwan Pontjowinoto, president director of P.T. Danareksa Fund Management, a state-controlled finance company that launched the first of the new open funds.\n\"We want to have local funds that can help the government by investing in the stock market,\" he said.\nThe new funds can only invest in domestic securities and are prohibited from selling more than one percent of their shares or units to any one investor, ensuring a wide investor base.\nThe new rules also ensure the funds are broadly invested, prohibiting them from spending more than 10 percent of their net asset value on any one company or buying securities representing more than five percent of the issuer's paid-up capital.\nThe conference, which attracted about 40 delegates from fund management companies, law firms, rating agencies and fund custodians around Asia, ended on Wednesday with a workshop on how to structure and price mutual funds.",

We are naturally saddened from a human point of view. But as regards business, I have to say it's business as usual,\" said Brigadier Christopher Hammerbeck, executive director of the British Chamber of Commerce.\nThe paramount leader won high praise from businessmen in Hong Kong for his economic reforms and for developing the \"one country, two systems\" policy which will prevail when sovereignty of Hong Kong reverts to China at midnight on June 30 under the terms of a 1984 Sino-British treaty.\n\"He was a great man of vision,\" said Ian Christie, director of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce.\n\"The 'one country, two systems' approach to the transfer of sovereignty, at that time, in 1984, showed incredible foresight and courage.\"\nGiven his contribution, it would have been better for all concerned if Deng had been able to witness the Hong Kong handover of July 1, said Mark Michelson, past chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce.\n\"He made it a lot easier for the transition to take place,\" Michelson said. \"At the same time, there has been a leadership succession in place for some time now associated with the transition. So...the practical impact will not be overwhelming.\"\nThe collective leadership now in place, led by President Jiang Zemin, has also been associated with the Hong Kong handover, Michelson said.\n\"So in the short-term there should be no impact, but in China one can never be sure,\" he said.\nMost business groups declined to speculate on the longer term implications of Deng's death.\nHong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper fretted over a possible power struggle emerging in Beijing.\n\"Although Deng's death is unlikely to result in a major immediate policy shift over Hong Kong, changes in the corridors of power in Beijing will spill over into the territory,\" the Post said.\nHong Kong's government-funded Trade Development Council said Deng will not be forgotten for his contribution to the territory's ascent up the world trade league tables.\n\"If one were to take a look in 1979, the year China began economic reform, at that time Hong Kong was number 23 in the world league of trading entities. Today we are number eight,\" said executive director Michael Sze.\nDeng is credited with the open door reforms which transformed China from an isolated economic backwater to emerging powerhouse.\n\"That just shows the tremendous progress we have made during the intervening years.\"\nHong Kong trade, now valued in excess of US$350 billion ($44.9 billion), is heavily dependent upon southern China where Hong Kong manufacturers own and operate 50,000 factories employing five million workers.\nThe gradual shift of Hong Kong's manufacturing base into the cheaper labour regions of southern China transformed the territory into a service-based economy geared to China's economic emergence.",

However, if the subsidiary is halal and the parent company not, the subsidiary is halal and will be accepted.\"\nThe same system will be set up in Indonesia by DCB-RHB's subisidiary, P.T. Rashid Hussain Asset Management, Nik said.\nHowever, there are substantial obstacles blocking the path to Moslem mutual fund investment in Indonesia. Among the most obvious is a relatively casual approach to religion.\n\"In Malaysia, the law is enforced. If you are not fasting the police can come and catch you, but in Indonesia, religion is encouraged but if you don't do it no one really cares,\" said one delegate to the conference.\nNik countered that 40 percent of Indonesia's Moslems are observant, but conceded that a 1,000-person survey disclosed that most were already investing in prohibited bank deposits.\n\"Earning interest on bank deposits is a no-no under Sharia law and 61 percent said they knew that, but there is no alternative investment,\" Nik said.\nHe admitted that persuading these investors to switch into lower-yielding stock market funds subject to profit-cleansing presented a formidable challenge. But he said that savings put towards the Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca offered hope.\n\"That will be the trick that we have to perform...but every year Indonesia has a high proportion of people going to Mecca,\" he said.\n\"This is my target market. If one of them were to save from ground zero to seven million rupiah into our fund before they redeem to go to Mecca, it is a captive market.\"\nEach year 195,000 Indonesian Moslems pay 7.55 million rupiah to participate in the government-organised pilgramage to Mecca.\n(US$1 = 2,327 rupiah)",

Get one percent and you double your assets under management,\" said Stewart Aldcroft, sales director for Templeton.\nBut it appears Hong Kong fund managers might be waiting in vain for a slice of the CalPERS pie.\nWhile expressing a desire to raise their Asian and international weightings, the United States pension funds clearly stated a preference for direct investment over listed equity.\n\"The amount of transparency that we would expect with the companies is not available at this point,\" CalPERS board president William Crist said of Chinese public companies.\nHis statement highlighted a significant problem for U.S. money managers seeking increased exposure to Asia.\nForeign access to Asian markets is usually restricted, partly because many countries fear the sort of economic disruption that widened current account deficits after the last wall of foreign money came marching into the region in 1993.\nHong Kong fund managers, pointing to research indicating superior Asian performance by funds managed from within the region rather than from outside, said one option that could meet everybody's needs is private equity funds.\nThe performance of these funds is private but believed to far exceed that of public mutual funds.\nMarcus Thompson, deputy managing director of HSBC Private Equity Management, said his funds hold $560 million, virtually all of it contributed by U.S. pension funds and invested in small companies expected to list within 10 years.\n\"Over the long term you're likely to get a superior investment performance,\" Thompson said. \"There's a discount for not being able to trade the stock.\"\nCesar Zalamea, managing director of AIG Investment Corp (Asia) Ltd, declined to reveal the performance of his funds except to describe it as \"tremendous\".\nAIG is the biggest private equity group active in Asia, with $2.38 billion under management -- nearly all of it rumoured to be contributed by one or two very big U.S. pension clients.\nZalamea said AIG's policy is always to hire Western-educated nationals who know the culture and the players in the indigenous business community. Established in Shanghai in 1919, AIG also has long-term relationships with many Asian corporations.\n\"When these (Asian corporations) decide they want to expand and invite investors outside family and close friends, we are naturals to be invited because (they) already know us,\" Zalamea said. \"CalPERS wouldn't have the kind of relationship.\"\nBut there are disadvantages to private equity funds, the most obvious being their closed-end and long-term nature.\n\"One of the key issues about investment is to have your money back when you're ready to have it back, not when those in whom you are investing want you to have it back,\" said Aldcroft, who candidly admits Templeton wants to manage CalPERS money.\nAnother fund manager warned that while many venture capital funds do very well, others do not.\n\"The risk is higher. You don't have an out. The trick is in knowing how to say no,\" he said. \"If you haven't picked the right companies, how do you get out?\"",

The push can come not just from banks, not just from private institutions, but from the government,\" said Venkatagiri Mudeliar, deputy general manager of Dresdner Thornton Asset Management in Singapore.\nDespite its obvious promise, Indonesia's mutual funds industry faces substantial obstacles, including unbeatable returns from bank deposits offering up to 17 percent per annum.\nOne speaker said that more than 60 percent of pension fund assets valued at US$2.4 billion were held in bank deposits. Seven newly-established mutual funds with assets of about US$642 million were similarly invested.\nAmong recommended measures at the conference were tax benefits for mutual fund investors, permission to allow domestic savings to flow offshore and a major educational drive.\nFelia Salim, director of the Jakarta Stock Exchange, told the conference that government discussions to provide a tax break to mutual fund investors were underway, and more than 40 percent of the bourse's budget for 1997 was dedicated to educating the public about the benefits of mutual fund investment.\nBut delegates said with international investment prohibited and foreign investment restrictions of 49 percent, incentives to setting up investment management subsidiaries in Indonesia were limited despite the industry's promise.\n\"Internationally, it's always a nervous position for a foreign fund manager to be in when it appears investment is a one-way street,\" said Paul Smith, managing director at the Bank of Bermuda in Hong Kong.\nForeign fund managers would be more likely to establish fund management subsidiaries in Indonesia if there were opportunities to manage Indonesian money offshore, he said.\n\"It's a hard call to make for a foreign fund manager to come down here and set up shop just to manage Indonesian domestic mutual fund business, which at the moment is a very small pie,\" Smith said.\nMudeliar said Indonesia is clearly committed to speeding up the establishment of its financial infrastructure, and catching up with its more developed Southeast Asian neighbours.\n\"Yes, they have lost out for a number of years but as you know nowadays knowledge is so freely available that they don't have to wait a full 15 years or 20 years,\" Mudeliar said.\n\"(They can make a) quantum leap in another five years.

Twentieth Century Fox is owned By News Corp Ltd.\nThe new regional headquarters, which forms a crucial part of Fox's recent restructuring, will oversee marketing and distribution for video subsidiaries in Japan, Korea, Australia and India.\n\"In the last two years, Fox Home Entertainment International has completely restructured the way we do business,\" Yapp said.\n\"We set out to establish regional offices to provide a regional focus and give us an opportunity to better coordinate local efforts,\" he said.\nAbout US$2 million has been spent and 15 people hired as part of the expansion into Asia, which accounts for 38 percent of the video division's revenue and contains its largest territory in terms of revenue contribution, Japan.\n\"It's for sure Japan is our major market and ahead of Hong Kong but this is a regional office and Hong Kong is the place in Asia to put your regional office,\" said Marc Cudennec, senior vice-president at Fox Home International.\nThe international focus was one of three critical strategies adopted in a drastic overhaul of Twentieth Century Fox 18 months ago, Yapp said.\n\"Fox realized that to become the premier filmed entertainment company, it had to focus on the international market place,\" he said.\nYapp said Asia's rising revenue contribution played a big role in reinforcing the importance of international expansion, as did an evening out of theatrical revenues from a prior ratio of 30 percent international, 70 percent U.S.\nFox's two other restructuring strategies, setting up four distinct production units and beefing up executive and creative talent, are well underway and reaping rewards, he added.\nThe number of films in development on the lot has increased from 60 to over 450 while the number of pictures being released by the studio has grown to 23 this year from 14 last year.\nFox also hopes to increase its share of the top 10 all time best selling live action videos from five to six with the video release on December 3 of its new blockbuster, Independence Day, which has grossed US$600 million in box office sales this year.\n\"Fox Home Entertainment is off to a very strong start on the road to the future,\" Yapp said. \"Our projected revenues will increase 30 percent in 1997 and contribution will increase by 43 percent.

It should be granted to everybody as a normal trading basis. This is our position.\"\nBut few in Hong Kong expect to see China win full MFN status in 1997, the year that China takes back Hong Kong from Britain.\n\"It's unfortunate. Were it not for this being the year of the return of Hong Kong to China, I think it would have been an opportune time for the U.S. Congress to finally extend permanent MFN status,\" said Frank Martin, the American chamber president.\n\"But it is going to be difficult this year. Many members of Congress are very likely to want to take a wait-and-see attitude.\"\nLegislation on permanent MFN has been submitted to Congress but has not been voted on.\nChina, which argues full MFN status is essential for healthy Sino-U.S. relations, granted Kolbe's congressional delegation an interview with President Jiang Zemin on Tuesday.\nPolitical analysts said Kolbe was committed to achieving permanent MFN status for China, but had tried to remind Beijing the United States wants to see a smooth handover in Hong Kong, where many are worried that China might impose repressive rule.\n\"Would a vote to tie MFN to the transition be a good idea? No,\" said one analyst, who declined to be identified.\n\"But to kind of use it one last time to signal concern while everyone knows annual MFN is going to go through doesn't hurt.\"\nChina's annual application for MFN status goes to Congress in May. It has won approval every year since 1990.\nHowever, former U.S. president George Bush was occasionally forced to use his presidential veto to eliminate various conditions that Congress attempted to attach.\nU.S. President Bill Clinton, who accused Bush of coddling tyrants in the 1992 U.S. presidential election campaign debates, de-linked the annual review of MFN from China's human rights record in 1995.",

Encased in bamboo scaffolding, Hong Kong's new convention centre only recently gained a partial roof, testament to the territory's speedy construction methods.\nThe meeting is expected to provide China with a showcase for the handover, which was evident in less obvious ways at Friday's IMF gathering, too.\nDeparting colonial governor Chris Patten started the day with a sideswipe at Beijing, telling delegates that Hong Kong's economic success was due largely to its increasingly democratic government.\n\"The government has responded (positively) to that process and to the changes in aspirations which have accompanied it, by welcoming ever wider public participation in the process of government,\" Patten said.\nTung Chee-hwa, the territory's incoming chief executive, ended the day with a reminder of traditional Chinese values of cooperation.\n\"Within our community of Asian countries we must forge cooperation through dialogue and understanding,\" he said in closing remarks.\nTo help foster this mood of cooperation, Tung pledged to visit his Asian neighbours soon.\n\"As soon as possible, I hope to be able to visit our neighbours in Asia to extend my hand of friendship and cooperation.\"\nYam cemented the day's upbeat handover theme with a reminder that, in economic terms, the \"one country, two systems\" policy was little more than maintenance of the status quo.\n\"Under these arrangements there will be one country, two currencies, two monetary systems and two monetary authorities which are to be mutually independent,\" he said.\n\"These arrangements are admittedly new but definitely not as novel and complex as EMU (European Monetary Union) with one currency for many countries,\" he added.\nBut as a reminder that things are changing irrevocably after 150 years of British rule, many of Hong Kong's colonial administrators were on their way home after seeing their careers cut short by \"localisation\".\nMany expatriates were sailing on two of the world's greatest cruise liners, the QE2 and the Oriana, a dramatic reminder that an era is ending and that Hong Kong itself will soon be sailing in uncharted waters.",

        "Text": "Thailand's banking sector crisis brought repeated calls for an upgrade of Asia's immature financial infrastructure at an International Monetary Fund-Hong Kong Monetary Authority meeting on Friday.\n\"Asia needs a stronger, more dynamic financial infrastructure,\" IMF managing director Michel Camdessus told the conference on financial integration in Asia.\nThe region's banking system has not kept pace with its economic development, and the speedy pace of economic reform has created an urgent need for an overhaul, delegates said.\n\"In many countries, in Asia and elsewhere, prudential regulation and supervision have not kept pace with the new complexities of the banking business,\" Camdessus said.\n\"If left unaddressed, this gap could pose dangers for domestic and external stability. Indeed, all countries must be vigilant about the strength of their banking systems, so that the monetary authorities can tighten policy when needed, without fear of aggravating banking sector problems.\"\nAsset quality problems forced Thailand to intervene earlier this week to demand better provisioning by its banks. Thailand was hampered in dealing with the situation by its monetary policy. Its currency, the baht, is pegged to a basket of currencies dominated by the dollar, but was under pressure from speculators who were encouraged by Thailand's poor economic picture and weak financial sector.\nLower rates would have eased liquidity -- but would also have lowered the cost of borrowing for currency speculators.\nHigher interest rates to ward off the speculators would have increased the cost of borrowing for the cash-strapped banks.\nWhile most speakers stopped short of calling for regional banking regulation and supervision to prevent the same situation occurring elsewhere -- an idea mooted by Australia recently -- some experts recommended frequent and regular gatherings of central bankers and finance ministers.\n\"Most countries need to take steps to strengthen the official supervisory oversight of financial institutions and markets,\" said Gerald Corrigan, managing director at Goldman Sachs and a former president of the New York and member of the Federal Open Market Committee.\nKey to the debate are capital inflows, which have widened current account deficits across Asia with serious implications for external balances and interest rates.\nCorrigan warned that while many Asian nations with wide current account deficits have taken comfort from large foreign exchange reserves, the capital inflows responsible for much of their foreign exchange can evaporate overnight.\n\"Deregulation has also led to a greater exposure of credit and foreign exchange risk, and increased the danger of banks being inadequately capitalised with consequent incentives to offer above-market interest rates and engage in less prudent lending,\" said Mahmood Pradhan, a senior economist with the IMF.\nThe situation is becoming more urgent as more and more nations in the region seek financing for the sort of huge infrastructure projects on which their future depends, he said.\n\"The challenge is for many of these countries to address their infrastructure needs, including environmental requirements, without putting undue strains on public finances or on external positions,\" Pradhan said.\nAlthough many Asian nations have successfully raised capital through privatisations, the amount of capital raised through privatisation in Asia was relatively small compared with Latin America, he said.",

        "Text": "Zero tax and limited regulation are luring billions of dollars into offshore mutual funds, spurring a growth industry in famed tax-free locations such as the Cayman Islands, according to a mutual fund legal expert.\n\"I think every indication is that the offshore part of the mutual fund industry will grow. In the offshore jurisdiction you have no taxation and a more appropriate level of regulation as a rule of thumb,\" said Anthony Travers, senior partner at Maples and Calder in Hong Kong.\nAnecdotal evidence suggests these advantages have drawn nearly US$900 billion into offshore mutual funds so far out of an entire industry sometimes valued at US$5 trillion, he said.\nA lack of professional infrastructure is often a compelling disincentive to authorising funds in countries offering the greatest returns, while high taxation levels deter mutual funds from setting up in promising developed markets, he said on Friday.\nThe alternative is to authorise the fund in an offshore region, avoiding tax while reaching into some of the world's most rewarding investment regions.\nThere are, however, drawbacks.\n\"If you go offshore and you invest into the onshore jurisdiction from your mutual funds, you have things like withholding tax and tax treatments that may be imposed on your profits, and marketing is very much an issue,\" Travers said.\nCertain double tax treaty networks can allow investors to avoid some onshore tax requirements, but these treaties vary from country to country, as do marketing restrictions, he said. For example, offshore mutual funds are prevented from marketing to more than 100 investors in the United States, while the United Kingdom prohibits marketing of offshore retail mutual funds unless they are based in designated jurisdictions, such as Bermuda, Jersey and Guernsey.\nIt is possible to market a Cayman Islands-registered mutual fund in the United Kingdom, but only as a private placement and not as a retail fund, Travers said.\nDespite their obvious benefits, Travers warned that investing in offshore mutual funds is not for everyone.\nThe lack of regulation gives greater flexibility in the establishment and administration of mutual funds but it also provides little recourse for unsophisticated retail investors, which partly explains why these funds cannot be marketed freely in the United States or the United Kingdom.\n\"You are essentially talking about mutual funds which are established by institutions for other institutions or very high net worth and sophisticated individuals, in which case it is felt additional layers of regulation are not appropriate or necessary,\" he said.\nIt is possible to market offshore retail funds in Europe, but funds must meet the requirements of the \"Undertakings of Collective Investment and Transfer of Securities\" (UCITS) directive, which ensures certain standards are met.\n\"They are supposed to be able to sell UCITS cross-border in Europe but in fact the European Union is still something of a myth when it comes to cross-border marketing,\" Travers said.\n\"And you find in these jurisdictions commensurately higher fees. Three to six basis points on net asset value is the price you pay to market to the retail sector,\" he said.",

But a few days ago, Leung contradicted earlier claims that he resigned for personal reasons and announced that he was forced to quit.\nThe Hong Kong government said on Saturday that no decision had yet been made on whether to release the reports but stressed its concern to uphold the privacy rights of civil servants.\nIt also noted that witnesses before the select committee enjoy all the rights and privileges of a witness in court.\n\"If that witness claims public interest immunity in relation to any document, he is entitled to put his reasons before the chairman for a ruling,\" the government said in a statement.\nGovernor Chris Patten on Sunday reiterated his support for Chan and civil service secretary Lam Woon-Kwong, but declined to comment on how the government would respond to the committee's demands next week.\n\"Everything that's been done by the Secretary for the Civil Service and others has been with my complete support and endorsement,\" Patten said.\nPolitical commentators said the Leung case had highlighted Legco's power to hold the Hong Kong government accountable.\nIn so doing, it has drawn attention to the sensitive issue of the future relationship between the executive and legislative branches of government in Hong Kong, and created something of a dilemma for Beijing, which has long argued that Legco became too powerful under Patten.\n\"The irony is that Beijing might find it extremely difficult to discredit Legco for doing the wrong thing now that the Government is being challenged on all fronts,\" political columnist Chris Yeung wrote in the South China Morning Post.\n\"But if it gives legislators a pat on the back, it would find itself giving credit to a body which it has decided to scrap on July 1.\"",

Were it not for this being the year of the return of Hong Kong to China, I think it would have been an opportune time for the U.S. Congress to finally extend permanent MFN status,\" said Frank Martin, the American chamber president.\n\"But it is going to be difficult this year. Many members of Congress are very likely to want to take a wait-and-see attitude.\"\nLegislation on permanent MFN has been submitted to Congress but has not been voted on.\nChina, which argues full MFN status is essential for healthy Sino-U.S. relations, granted Kolbe's congressional delegation an interview with President Jiang Zemin on Tuesday.\nPolitical analysts said Kolbe was committed to achieving permanent MFN status for China, but had tried to remind Beijing the United States wants to see a smooth handover in Hong Kong, where many are worried that China might impose repressive rule.\n\"Would a vote to tie MFN to the transition be a good idea? No,\" said one analyst, who declined to be identified.\n\"But to kind of use it one last time to signal concern while everyone knows annual MFN is going to go through doesn't hurt.\"\nAs the leading entrepot for China-U.S. trade, the Hong Kong government has always backed China's application for MFN status. But on Wednesday it declined to comment on Kolbe's remarks.\nChina's annual application for MFN status goes to Congress in May. It has won approval every year since 1990.\nHowever, former U.S. president George Bush was occasionally forced to use his presidential veto to eliminate various conditions that Congress attempted to attach.\nU.S. President Bill Clinton, who accused Bush of coddling tyrants in the 1992 U.S. presidential election campaign debates, de-linked the annual review of MFN from China's human rights record in 1995.",

The communique followed a speech on Wednesday by President Jiang Zemin, who has staked much of his political credibility on fighting graft and who said the anti-corruption battle was a struggle upon which the fate of the nation and party depended.\nIt reminded government officials that they were forbidden from exploiting their political clout to secure loans, goods or business contracts for their spouses or children.\nBeijing would also punish officials in loss-making state-owned firms who used company funds for personal use or who caused huge business losses through mismanagement, it said.\nDisciplinary watchdogs would maintain a vigilant eye for officials who failed to toe the party line and be good communists, it said.\n\"Officials at every level...must strictly observe political discipline and maintain agreement with the central government in politics, ideology and action,\" it said.\n\"Party members, leaders and officials must...be honest in performing their duties, be staunch in their faith in communism and diligently uphold communist values,\" it said.\nThose who violated political discipline would be strictly punished, it said without elaborating.\nCorruption, virtually unknown in China under the strict Stalinist rule of the late party Chairman Mao Zedong, who led the communists to power in 1949, has boomed during nearly two decades of market-oriented economic reform.\nDisciplinary authorities punished more than 116,000 officials for exploiting their positions for personal gain in 1996, up 14.3 percent from the year before, discipline committee chairman Wei Jianxing said this week.\nMore than 72,000 officials had owned up to using their power to obtain better housing, with 74 percent handing over a total of 94 million yuan ($11.3 million) to pay for the housing.\nAnalysts say Jiang, who in 1989 was plucked from his post as Shanghai party secretary to become anointed successor to paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, is anxious to win popular loyalty with his high-profile anti-graft campaign.\nWhile the president and party chief has won some credit from the netting of corrupt senior officials such as former Beijing party chief and Politburo member Chen Xitong, many Chinese say results of the corruption crackdown have been patchy at best.",

It did not specify what adjustments were needed.\nTaiwan has barred direct trade and transport links with the mainland since the two were separated at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Taipei has clung to its ban as a last bargaining chip in talks on reunification with Beijing.\nChina's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong this year is expected to give Beijing more leverage in any talks.\n\"With the return of Hong Kong and that of Macau in 1999, the solution of the Taiwan question and the motherland's reunification will become more prominent issues for all Chinese people,\" Xinhua said.\nAnalysts have said Jiang is eager to bring Taiwan into the mainland's communist fold to etch his name in history alongside the late Chairman Mao Zedong and current paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who negotiated the return of Hong Kong from Britain.\nChina would continue to promote economic exchanges between the two sides while keeping a vigilant watch over any movement toward independence for Taiwan, the Xinhua commentary said.\n\"The fight against separatism and Taiwan independence has illustrated the Chinese people's strong determination and ability...to strike hard against separatist activities and Taiwan-independence forces in Taiwan,\" the agency said.",

A doctor at the scene said her injury was not serious but she was taken by ambulance to a hospital in the city of Guilin.\n\"This was extremely treacherous terrain and a very difficult climb,\" said Liotta.\nJournalists who made the trek to the site saw a pile of charred and twisted metal wedged into a narrow crevass on the mountain side.

Beijing has urged the United States to make such treatment permanent.\n\"We hope the Most Favoured Nation issue will be solved once and for all,\" Wu said.\nChina is one of the United States' largest trading partners.\nU.S. companies sold about $12 billion worth of goods to China last year, while Americans bought some $46 billion worth Chinese products.\nWu also called on Washington to work harder with Beijing to hammer out conditions whereby China could secure a coveted seat in the WTO, saying such moves would benefit trade links.\nChina has insisted on entering the world trade body under the easier terms accorded to developing nations. But many developed nations, including the United States, have demanded tougher entry requirements because of the sheer size of China's economy.\n\"Smooth settlement of the two issues would prove to be a great impetus to Sino-U.S. trade and economic cooperation,\" Wu said.\nHe said China's total foreign trade would hit $280 billion this year and forecast that figure to balloon to $400 billion in 2000 and $800 billion in 2010. She did not say how much exports or imports were expected to be.\nLast month the United States decided to set punitive charges against China's 1996 textile quotas in a move that Beijing says was made without full consultation.\n\"We would like the United States to change it's decision,\" Wu said. \"Otherwise, China will take measures in response.\"",

        "Text": "North Korea expects a shortfall of two million tonnes of grain next year -- equal to 40 percent of the nation's needs and significantly worse than expected, a Red Cross official said on Monday.\nOnly a few months ago, aid workers had estimated the food shortage would be 1.5 million tonnes.\n\"Their shortages are serious...they (North Korean officials) have not been able to meet the daily food ration,\" said Ole Gronning, representative of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in North Korea's capital of Pyongyang.\n\"This is bad news, really bad news in a country that already doesn't have much now,\" Gronning said by telephone.\nHe said farmers whose crops had been wiped out by devastating floods in July had eaten about 400,000 tonnes of grain before it came to maturity, adding this would worsen the food shortage this winter.\nNorth Korea has faced the spectre of famine since July after the floods destroyed about 373,000 tonnes of grain, compounding damage from widespread floods in 1995.\nOfficial figures showed North Korea would need 5.5 million tonnes of grain next year, but this year's harvest had yielded just 3.5 million tonnes, Gronning said.\nThe federation was trying to raise $10.5 million for a new programme to buy grain to stave off hunger for some 140,000 North Koreans badly hit by the floods, he said.\n\"In some of the villages and the valleys we are now going into, they were working on repairing the damage from the 1995 floods and then they got hit once again,\" he said.\n\"They have lost everything, including houses, livestock and so on,\" he said.\nThe summer floods had submerged large tracts of arable land for more than 10 days. Some of that land was now covered in sand and mud and could not be farmed again.\n\"The second floods left people in a really bad situation,\" Gronning said. \"People will be running out of food in the second half of December.\"\nThe federation would work with the North Korean Red Cross Society to distribute a daily ration of 450 grams (15.75 ounces) of grain and a helping of supplementary foods such as soybeans to each person, he said.\nAid workers would try to provide stricken residents with winter clothes and blankets to brace against winter temperatures that could drop as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius, he said.\n\"Without enough food and without proper heating, these people are really badly off,\" he said.\nNorth Korea, despite its philosophy of self-reliance, cracked open the door to foreign aid last year in the face of looming food shortages.\nGronning said the federation had appealed to member societies in Europe, North America and Japan to donate money urgently needed to start buying grain and clothes.\n\"Hopefully, we will have the first pledges very, very soon so we can start purchasing,\" he said.",

They also carry the heavy burden of providing cradle-to-grave welfare services for their employees.\nThe combined losses of state firms reached 65.12 billion yuan ($7.8 billion) during the first nine months of the year, a rise of 45.7 percent from a year ago, official figures show.\nCompounding the problem is interest on unpaid debts -- a substantial burden even after two interest rate cuts this year.\n\"The debt burden of state-owned enterprises is very heavy, so of course this affects their profitability,\" Zheng said.\nThe January-September net profits of China's state industries fell to 11.28 billion yuan, down 75.8 percent from the same period last year, the statistics show.\nReform of defence industries -- many based in remote and backward inland regions and fitted with ageing technology -- had proceeded slowly, the economist said.\n\"Military industries are trying to transform into civilian industries, but the transition is extremely difficult -- there's no capital,\" he said.\nOfficials have said more than 200 state firms have been declared insolvent to date but Beijing has been wary of pushing ahead with bankruptcies.\nBeijing fears that reform of state enterprises will lead to mass unemployment and eventually spark social unrest, said one Western analyst reached by telephone.\n\"That's one major reason why reform is going so slowly,\" said the analyst, who declined to be identified.\nChina's trade unions had set up a special fund this year to help workers in ailing state firms, the China Daily newspaper said on Friday.\n\"The relief fund...is designed to help employees from money-losing state-owned enterprises maintain decent living standards,\" the newspaper said.\nUnions had raised 1.2 billion yuan so far this year to help about seven million impoverished workers in state enterprises and disaster-stricken areas, it said.\n($1 = 8.3 yuan)",

He did not elaborate.\nBeijing has repeatedly cracked down on monks and nuns in the deeply devout Buddhist region and accused the clergy of playing a major role in an underground Tibetan campaign against communist rule.\nTibet has been rocked by anti-Chinese protests by monks and nuns since the 1980s. Communist troops marched into Tibet in 1950.\nThe London-based watchdog group Tibet Information Network reported earlier this week that a jailed Tibetan nun had had her sentence doubled to 18 years for defying Beijing's choice of the reincarnation of the region's second holiest monk.\nThe party boss also warned that superstitious beliefs had made a recent comeback in the region because the Dalai Lama had used religion to drug the people.\nUgly religious practices had appeared again in wedding and funeral ceremonies and other aspects of social life, Chen said.\nReligion had even taken root among some government officials and threatened to hinder the economic development of the backward and remote region, Chen said.\n\"These negative ideas and actions block the spread of science and technology and hinder the development of productive forces,\" he said.",

It also has a listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange.\nFounder's net assets totalled HK$494.9 million at the end of 1995 and the company posted net profit of HK$109 million last year on sales turnover of HK$1.1 billion.\nWang, the 59-year-old chairman of what has perhaps become one of China's most successful computer companies, predicted the firm would continue its strong performance as the domestic market expands and it finds new opportunities abroad.\nThe company's net profit in the first six months of this year rose a year-on-year 7.0 percent to HK$55.8 million and turnover shot up 27 percent to HK$590 million.\n\"I can confidently say that we will see an increase in both turnover and profit in 1996,\" Wang said.\nFounder is China's fourth biggest manufacturer of personal computers but Wang says he plans to focus his energies on the more interesting -- and lucrative -- software business.\n\"Selling personal computers is all about sales technique,\" Wang said. \"I get very excited about high-tech stuff, much more than business.\"\nFounder had snared 78 percent of China's publishing software market as of August, up from 70 percent at the end of 1995, Wang said.\nThe company also boasted clients among Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and North America, he said.\nFounder's office automation products were gaining popularity among Chinese banks, government agencies and advertising firms, he said.\nWang has visited numerous companies abroad and said he was confident Founder would crack the Japanese market in two years and be a strong player in the international market within five years.\nAs part of Wang's drive to boost Founder's role overseas, the firm signed a pact last May to develop publishing solutions based on products and technology of U.S.-based Apple Computer Inc\nWang listed Founder in Hong Kong in December 1995. Beijing University still holds 56 percent of the company.\nInitially offered at HK$1.98 a share, Founder's stock shot up to a high of HK$4.0 a share earlier this year though it has since fallen back.

I think discussions will continue for a while yet this year.\"\nOne analyst suggested that it was encouraging that the company had passed up the opportunity to tone down expectations.\nThe Pru is believed to be looking to free up around three billion pounds ($4.9 billion) of orphan assets -- money built up in with-profits funds surplus to policyholders' needs.\nPru operating profits for the year rose over eight percent to 873 million pounds, with profits from continuing operations of 691 million pounds.\nThe combination of the confidence about new business prospects in 1997 and a higher-than-expected level of profitable new business in 1996 helped lift the shares by 11 pence to 574 pence.\nA 10 percent rise in the dividend to a slightly higher than forecast 17.3 pence per share also provided support.\nPru's chief executive Sir Peter Davis called it a very successful year and said the results demonstrated the strength of the group's core business.\nWith the disposal of Mercantile & General (M&G) and the launch of Prudential Banking, considerable progress had been made in focusing the group on markets where the Pru had the expertise and the critical mass to generate real value for shareholders, he said.\nThe sale of M&G for 1.75 billion pounds in December realised a profit of 766 million pounds.\nPrudential Banking, launched on October 1, is already processing applications for 103 million pounds of mortgages and has taken 98 million pounds in deposits.\nThe company plans to expand the product range and move in to the personal loan market later this year.\nBloomer repeated the Pru's interest in establishing the high street distribution network which a building society acquisition would provide. With net cash at year-end standing at 1.1 billion pounds, the group has the financial strength to contemplate such a move.\nBut Bloomer said it was unlikely to make a move unless it enhanced shareholder value which, given current price levels in the sector, may be difficult to pull off.\nThe Pru is currently involved in a takeover battle for Scottish Amicable and made an initial 1.9 billion pound offer for the mutually-owned life insurer earlier this month, only 250 million pounds of which will come from shareholders' funds.\nPrudential UK operating profits from the insurance business increased eight percent to 398 million pounds and profits for the savings and investment business were 323 million pounds, an increase of six percent.\nAfter cutting Prudential UK's cost base by 170 million pounds over the past four years, it was approaching a point of diminishing returns, though the group was looking to reduce unit costs further, Bloomer said.\nU.S. operations Jackson National Life saw operating profits growing 35 percent to $512 million.\nWhile confident about the outlook for the business, Bloomer said growth was unlikely to continue at the 40 percent rate seen in recent years.

British Petroleum was up 5-1/2p at 628p and Shell Transport 6-1/2p at 939p. In Amsterdam, Royal Dutch rose 2.70 guilders to 250.70.\nThe Iraqi humanitarian oil sales had been expected to hit markets in the next few weeks but after the latest developments traders were questioning when and if those supplies would come back on stream.\nThat could mean an upward revision of as much as $1.50 on Brent crude oil prices for the next few months with the possibility of the Iraqi sales ban lasting into 1997.\n\"I'd rather wait and see how likely or how long delays to Iraqi sales are going to be before I get too panicky,\" said one leading oil analyst.\n\"Almost certainly there is going to be a strong fourth quarter now as well as the third. People are going to have upgrade numbers for this year but for next year it's a bit early to say.\"\nThe resultant boost to earnings forecasts are likely to provide support to share prices across the sector with most analysts having expected an oil price fall in the fourth quarter as the humanitarian sales came through.\nConsensus forecasts had been around $17.70 per barrel for the fourth quarter compared with an average of just under $20 in the third, analysts said.\n\"We were forecasting $19.50 for the third. We'll have to raise that in the light of this news and also our fourth quarter which was $17.50 by between $1 and $1.50 per barrel,\" said Lehman Bros' Wendy Anderson.\n\"The purest plays are the exploration and production companies - Enterprise, Lasmo and Saga. You pick a pure play if you believe the delay will last into 1997,\" said Anderson.\nIntegrated majors Norsk Hydro, BP, Elf, Total and Royal Dutch/Shell also provided fairly good exposure, she said.\nTotal shares rose 4.2 francs at 376.7 in Paris and Elf gained 7.6 francs to 376.4. Norsk Hydro added two Norwegian crowns to 296.50.\nBut while the Iraqi situation will underpin stocks in the near term, it is long-term trends that will determine significant outperformance in the sector.\nThe real issue was at what point -- if at all -- people decided that forecasts for oil prices through 1997, 1998 and 1999 should be higher, said Nick Antill of BZW.\n\"At this stage I don't see anything that would make one want to do that. In investment terms, the sector is only really going to start motoring if people start bumping up the long-term trend rather than just this year's estimate,\" he said.",

The asset value is the only rationale as to why the shares are sitting at current levels,\" said one.\n\"Any large life acquisition would almost certainly result in paying a very substantial premium to asset value.\"\nThe decline in 1996 profits was broadly in-line with market expectations. Despite continuing pressures on margins, Guardian chief executive John Robins said there were bright spots.\nThe company had seen some hardening of premiums in selected sectors and regions such as British motor insurance and difficult conditions in Germany had not been as severe as some commentators had forecast.\nIt predicted rates in the motor market could rise by as much as eight percent over the next twelve months with household rates likely to see smaller increases of the order of two percent.\nCompetition in commercial markets continued to be fierce, though even here there were hopes of an upturn in rates by the end of the year.\nFor 1996, however, Guardian trading profits were down over 17 percent at 281 million pounds, before restructuring costs of 39 million pounds.\nPre-tax profits including investment gains dropped to 651 million pounds from 812 million pounds last year. Total premium income was down only slightly at 3.73 billion pounds.\nWhile competition had risen and was likely to increase further, Guardian said it was confident about the future and that this was reflected in the increase in the dividend payout for the year by one pence to 10.0 pence per share.\nThe figures were broadly in line with market expectations although the headline operating profit was flattered by reserve releases to the tune of 10 to 15 million pounds and by a profit contribution from the internal reinsurance operation which may not be repeated.\nProgress had been made on the integration of last year's acquisition of Legal & General's commercial business and of the RAC insurance business.\nRestructuring of the group's operations in Britain was also moving ahead, the company said.\nA new management structure was set up at the beginning of 1997 and cost savings in the next two years are expected to equal this year's 39 million pounds of exceptional charges.\nThose charges are expected to cover all the costs required to complete the restructuring over the next 12 to 18 months and while these might include further redundancies, these were unlikely to be of the same order of previous rounds of layoffs.

We have a strategy for growing our business which we're comfortable with and as far as we're concerned that's what we're concentrating on,\" group executive director Max Taylor told Reuters in an interview.\nFollowing the implementation of the Lloyd's of London Reconstruction and Renewal plan (R&R) the group's members agency returned to profit for the first time since 1992.\nThe 14.5 million pound profit commission for the 1993 year included reserves from prior years. These were partly offset by contributions of 6.3 million pounds to the R&R plan.\nWillis said present indications were that profit commission on the 1994 year, receivable in 1997, will be around half those of 1993.\nProfits for the 1995 year were likely to be significantly down, however, said one analyst, and there were big questions over whether it would be profitable at all in 1997 given the rating environment.\nAfter severance costs of 11.3 million pounds in the 1996 figures related to the change programme, Taylor said he expected further costs in 1997 to be lower.\nHe said a fall in staff numbers of 11 percent in 1996 was unlikely to be repeated and further reductions were expected to be on a smaller scale and absorbed through natural wastage.\nThe change programme is expected to span three to five years and last year's actions were taken to underpin it. The real effort would now be going into the longer term effort of building capabilities, skills and resources, said Taylor.\n($ = 0.612 British Pounds)",

The two million with-profit members will receive a minimum of 300 shares with additional shares based on the value and duration of their holdings as of October 1, 1996.\nThree-quarters of with-profit policyholders - life insurance policies which share in the investment profits of the life fund through bonuses - will get between 300 and 600 shares. Non-profit members will get a fixed allocation of 150 shares.\nMost of Norwich Union's half-a-million overseas members will have the choice of a cash payment instead of free shares.\nThe flotation will allow the separation of the group's life operations from the risks associated with its more volatile and cyclical general business.\nIt will also strengthen the group's financial position and allow the core life business greater investment freedom.\nThe general insurance business will be transferred from the life fund to shareholder ownership and the life and pensions operations to a subsidiary company.\nNorwich Union, which reported pre-tax profit in 1996 of 483 million pounds, said it believed the opportunities for sustained growth were good but that results in its general insurance arm would continue to be affected by pricing pressure in 1997, particularly in Britain.\nAround 1.5 billion pounds of the money raised under today's plans will go into the with-profits fund to enable the company to continue to keep up policy benefits to existing policyholders.\nThe balance, less the 120 million pound cost of the flotation, will be used for corporate purposes.\nWhile the company did not rule out the possibility of future acquisitions, it said it had no immediate plans to do so and was not \"raising a war chest.\"\nPolicyholders circulars were due to be mailed on Thursday and the group expects the prospectus for the additional share offer to be issued in May.

The cost savings will be there but they would come out in the merger of any two companies,\" he said.\nCarter will become chief executive of the new group which is to be renamed Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group Plc.\nThe deal comes at a time of increasing problems for brokers as insurance rates fall and revenues decline. Increasing competitive pressures are forcing many to contemplate deals to find a way of cutting costs and achieve economies of scale.\nOnly last week U.S. broking giant Aon Corp announced it was buying New York's Alexander & Alexander services for $1.23 billion.\n\"Insurance brokers are going through very difficult times and any activity that will enhance margins has to be beneficial,\" said one analyst. \"It's becoming quite evident that size is more and more important.\" Under the terms of the Lloyd's Thompson offer, JIB shareholders will receive four new Lloyd Thompson shares for every five JIB shares held. The companies said that deal was expected to be \"significantly earnings enhancing\" in 1998.\nThe merger has received the backing of Jardine Matheson Holdings which has a 60 percent stake in JIB. On completion of the merger it will have a 34 percent interest which it said, it intended to hold \"for the long term\".\nThe stock market reacted positively to the news. JIB shares rose 20-1/2p to 129-1/2p and Lloyd Thompson 1-1/2p to 174p.\nThe companies said they believed that the merger would bring significant strategic advantages allowing the development of new products, enhancing JIB's international operations and creating a leading international reinsurance business.\nThe deal would also deliver cost savings, in particular in the two London market operations' information technology and head office expenditure.\nLloyd Thompson, is currently involved predominantly in the London wholesale and reinsurance broking business. In contrast, JIB, operates in 30 countries worldwide and brings with it an international presence with the \"very significant jewel in the crown\" of its high quality Asia Pacific business, said Carter.\nThe newly merged group will be positioned between global brokers such as Britain's Sedgwick and Willis Corroon and smaller niche brokers such as Lowndes Lambert and C.E. Heath.\n\"We see Jardine fulfilling an essential demand from clients by being a strong international broker focussed on handling business wherever it is in the world outside the U.S. rather than looking to get a flag in every city in the world,\" said Carter.\nFollowing the merger John Barton, currently chief executive of JIB will become chairman of the new group which is to be headquartered in London.",

Last year's four percent April increase resulted in an eventual rise of between two and three percent.\nThere were, however, no signs of rate increases in the homeowner or commercial sectors, said Scott.\nDespite the fall in 1996 profits and even allowing for a 10 million pound boost from a change in the way the group accounts for overseas earnings, the results were at the top end of market expectations.\nYear-end net assets per share, up a slightly less-than-expected three percent at 675 pence by year-end, have since risen to 734 pence.\nA 10-1/2 percent increase in the dividend for the year to 34.25 pence per share was also ahead of forecast and by late afternoon the shares had added 11 pence to 848 pence.\nAnalysts welcomed a resilient underwriting performance, especially in the fourth quarter in Britain and the United States, and the level of profitability in new business in the group's life operations.\n\"There's some justification in adding some goodwill over the net asset value (NAV) into the share price for future profitable new business in life,\" commented one analyst.\nThe acquisition of Provident Mutual in January 1996 helped fuel a 37 percent increase in life and pension profits over the year to 108 million pounds.\nProvident contributed 18 million pounds after reorganisation costs of 16 million pounds and Scott said the group was now looking to capitalise on the pension expertise which Provident had brought.\nThe key for the life company was the profitability of new business, said Scott, but he ruled out any major acquisitions in the drive to expand the business.\n\"At the present time there's nothing wrong with organic growth in life. We've proved we're capable of achieving that.\"\nThe group has set itself the goal of increasing the proportion of more stable life earnings to a level which covers dividends each year. In 1996 the proportion of dividend covered by net life earnings in 1996 was 44 percent.\nScott also dismissed speculation of a merger or takeover involving General Accident.\n\"We've got the benefits of scale in our major businesses. We don't have to do anything. We'd like to make further acquisitions in the U.S. Midwest but don't see any need to dramatically change our current shape,\" said Scott.\nInvestment income over the year was up seven percent but the rise in stock markets to record levels over 1996 has prompted the company to reduce exposure to British and North American equities over the past three quarters and shift money into bonds.

It's early days, there's plenty of time for them to draw breath and talk to us.\"\nThe second element of the offer would see Abbey National invest between 700 million and one billion pounds into the with-profits fund, where the policyholder is entitled to a share of the profits from the growth of the fund.\nScottish Amicable said the approach from Abbey was vague and it was unclear how it was valuing the group. The insurer, based in Stirling, Scotland, said it intends to publish in 10 days time detailed proposals about a twin-phased transformation, involving losing its mutual status on May 1 and a 1.0 billion pound flotation in three to five years time.\n\"The start of a growth phase is the wrong time in the cycle for policyholders to put their businesss on the market,\" said Sandy Stewart, chairman of Scottish Amicable.\nLater, a spokesman for Scottish Amicable's advisers said there was a \"grave danger of policy holders being misled by the vague terms of Abbey National's pronouncements. They have misunderstood Scottish Amicable's proposals.\"\nThe spokesman said the benefits to policy holders of the flotation proposal had been conservatively stated and the actual value would be considerably higher.\nAbbey's Toner said the Scottish Amicable business would be an excellent fit for its Scottish Mutual business which it bought in 1992. It has 8.0 billion pounds under management and sells its products through the independent financial adviser (IFA) network.\n\"We started quite cautiously with Scottish Mutual but now it's growing very strongly under our management but as the whole life sector continues to consolidate, we do think it would be good, with the right partner, to link Scottish Mutual with something else,\" he added.",

I think everybody's waiting to see whether anyone wants to have a shootout now - it's a bit of a stand off... it's very much a case of playing by ScotAm's rules,\" said a source close to one of the bidders.\nThose rules include confidentiality agreements and an undertaking to accept the board's decision, expected by the end of the month, as final.\nScotAm, based in Stirling in central Scotland, has arranged for an independent tribunal to resolve any dispute arising from the the takeover battle.\nThe board has repeatedly stressed that the interests of its 1.1 million policyholders will be uppermost in its final decision.\nThose interests are not limited to headline figures and upfront payouts but extend to the bidders long-term investment plans.\nOne of Warburg's main difficulties will be comparing what are likely to be very differently structured proposals, and independent actuaries and the Department of Trade & Industry will be consulted before a decision is made.\nJob security for ScotAm's 2,200 employees is also likely to play its part and all three bidders have been quick to calm fears of job cuts at ScotAm.\nAMP has said it would consider moving its Bristol-based London Life buisness to Scotland if it won while both Abbey and the Pru have said job preservation in Stirling would be a priority.\nAMP, Abbey and the Pru are all that are left of half a dozen companies, including National Westminster Bank and Lloyds TSB who last month signed confidentiality agreements with ScotAm to evaluate the company as a takeover prospect.\nThe final price -- widely expected to top two billion pounds ($3.2 billion) -- is said to have deterred many from taking their interest further and Lloyds admitted recently that after running the slide rule over ScotAm, it felt the bid premium looked too high.\nBoth the Pru and Abbey have already said that their original proposals might be increased once they had access to more detailed financial detail on ScotAm.\nAbbey's original bid was worth up to 1.4 billion pounds while the Pru's 1.9 billion pound offer included a loan element to bolster ScotAm's life fund.\nThose bids came barely two weeks after ScotAm had published its own proposals to shed its mutual status and float itself on the stock market.\nAMP has not yet given any indication of what it might be prepared to pay for ScotAm, but is financially strong has said it was keen to make acquisitions in both the British and U.S. market.\n($ = 0.627 British Pounds)",

The reforms enlarged the mass franchise when the present Legislative Council (Legco) was elected last year with a landslide for pro-democracy forces.\nSaturday's vote was a turning point in Hong Kong's future and moved Legco a step closer to oblivion.\nEvents are moving apace, with less than 200 days to go before the change of flag. Ten days ago the Selection Committee chose Tung Chee-hwa, a 59-year-old shipping magnate with strong pro-Beijing loyalties, to succeed Patten next July 1.\nThe Hong Kong public has had no say in who should be their first Chinese leader and lawmakers after the British withdrawal. Nor have they had a say in the removal of their elected legislators.\nA survey this week showed only a third of Hong Kong people backed the provisional legislature and only a quarter trusted China.\nThe creation of the interim lawmaking body in Shenzhen was conducted amid tight security.\nTrucks towed away suspicious cars hours before the meeting began and guards with binoculars were posted atop the building across the street from the voting hall.\nSome of more than 100 journalists, many of whom arrived on Friday, were detained for up to an hour while their travel documents were verified by Chinese border guards.",

But Sinopec in Beijing is pushing for a more suitable ratio of 1:1.4, the source said, adding that the change would take some months to materialise.\nDiesel import quotas, which were not fully utilised in 1996 due to high international prices, might also have exacerbated the shortage in the supply chain, and China might be forced to import more this year, the Sinopec source said.\nHe declined to estimate the amount of diesel likely to be imported this year.\nThe plan to raise domestic diesel output comes after two officially sanctioned price rises in late 1996 to encourage refiners to produce more diesel, Chinese oil sources said.\nDomestic diesel prices had been frozen at 1,900 yuan per tonne since May 1994, when Beijing imposed strict price ceilings to crack down on profiteering. Prices were raised to 1,990 yuan per tonne in October 1996 and 2,190 yuan per tonne in December.\nWhile Beijing, fearful of inflation, keeps a watch on prices, Chinese oil sources admit there is little central authorities can do to prevent flagrant price spikes in far-flung provinces hit by shortages.\n\"In situations of shortage, provinces can raise prices, it is difficult for Beijing to control,\" the Sinopec source said.\nHowever, some Chinese sources said earlier this week that shortages might only be isolated to some inland provinces as some coastal regions were still enjoying high inventories.\n\"Storage levels are healthy in some areas,\" said a Singapore-based trader with Chinese state oil trader Sinochem.\nStorage terminals at some coastal regions were at full capacity after importers sucked in a massive 1.9 million tonnes that started arriving from mid-January, a Sinopec source in Singapore said.\n\"Central authorities were afraid there wouldn't be enough for spring and even refiners were urged to crank up their gas oil production,\" he said.\nAuthorities might have frozen import quotas for now -- until the bottleneck clears -- but it was likely to be short term because China was short of diesel for this year, he added.\nA Chinese oil trader from the southern Maoming refinery, China's second largest, said diesel prices had hit as high as 5,000 yuan per tonne in some provinces suffering shortages.\n\"Prices were between 4,000 and even 5,000 yuan in December in places like Hunan and Sichuan,\" the trader said by telephone earlier this week. Refineries raised prices because their net costs had increased.\nChinese refiners have had sharply reduced profit margins since Beijing raised domestic crude prices by about 110 yuan in January 1996 to between 864 and 794 yuan a tonne on 80 percent of its crude sold within the country.\nFearful of an inflationary backlash, Beijing had, until October, kept prices of all oil products unchanged. Sinopec, which made exceptional profits in 1995 and 1994, bore the brunt of the rise in crude prices.\n\"Refining margins last year, compared with the earlier two years, were very bad. A lot of our profit went to our upstream companies,\" the Sinopec source said.",

It is not a threat...but we want to first see what happens,\" he said in a speech to the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong Kong.\nThe freewheeling British colony of over a century and a half is promised far-reaching autonomy for 50 years under a Sino-British treaty and related documents.\nQuoting the ancient Chinese sage Confucius, Boucher said a measure of whether Hong Kong was well ruled after 1997 would be if \"its subjects are content and foreigners are attracted\".\nHe reminded Beijing of its promises made about Hong Kong -- the survival of freedom of speech, press, assembly, movement, travel, religion, among others. \"That is a sweeping, vital and unrestricted pledge,\" he said.\nWith only 203 days left under the British flag, Hong Kong people are nervous over the future of these freedoms and about China's plan to replace their elected Legislative Council with a provisional legislature, to be chosen this month, overseen by Beijing.\nBoucher, echoing criticisms made previously by other senior U.S. diplomats, described the provisional body as \"unnecessary and unjustified\".\n\"It is important for Hong Kong to have a legislature that is constitutionally elected.\"\nBoucher refrained from commenting on whether Hong Kong Chinese residents holding U.S. passports would enjoy U.S. consular protection after the handover.\n\"We do in every case offer consular protection when we can but the question of dual nationality is very complicated...and I can't give details now,\" he said. Some 37,200 U.S. citizens live in Hong Kong, many of them dual nationals.\nBoucher also said China had signalled to Washington that U.S. Navy ships could continue to make recreational port visits to Hong Kong after 1997, although details had to be worked out.\nAbout 70 U.S. warships call in at Hong Kong each year.",

It was not immediately clear if they were arrested.\nFellow legislators Andrew Cheng of the Democratic Party and trade union leader Lee Cheuk-yan were also hauled away.\n\"It's a sad day for Hong Kong. What can ordinary Hong Kong citizens do -- they cannot vote,\" John Wing-ling Tse, a legislator of the Democratic Party said.\nEarlier, protesters erected a \"tomb of democracy\" outside the building and condemned the voting as the end of freedom and the rule of law in the territory.\nOnly the 400 electors chosen by China voted for the future leader. None of the rest of Hong Kong's 6.3 million people had a vote.\nSeveral hundred pro-democracy activists demonstrated on Tuesday evening and 20 diehards camped out overnight with the imitation tomb in front of the Grand Hyatt Hotel.\nAs the Selection Committee members arrived in shiny limousines, their first sight was an imitation ancient Chinese-style grey arched tomb, constructed from wood.\nThe structure faced the Hong Kong Convention Centre with the inscription \"Tomb Of Hong Kong Democracy And Rule Of Law\". Candles flickered in the wind beside it.\nThe committee was convened to carry out the first of two historic tasks -- to elect the man who will step into the shoes of Governor Chris Patten when Britain pulls out. The clear favourite was shipping magnate Tung Chee-Hwa.\nThe committee's second task, on December 21, is to choose a provisional legislature that will replace the current elected Legco (Legislative Council) on July 1.\nThe scuffles erupted after police urged the demonstrators, from the United Front Against the Provisional Legislature, to move to a cordoned-off area.\nOccasionally the group marched a short distance bearing the tomb aloft, as in a funeral procession. In front of the tomb a banner was posted saying \"Death of Hong Kong Rule Of Law\".\n\"We are against the Selection Committee's so-called election of the first chief executive,\" said Cheng. \"The selection is not real because it is done by Beijing,\" the legislator said.\nThe protesters brandished a colourful banner with the slogan \"Oppose the False Election Of The Chief Executive, Oppose The Provisional Legislature\" and denounced China for not allowing Hong Kong's electorate to vote.\n\"This is an abuse of their human rights. Some people are more equal and have more rights. In other cultures it is always your vote that counts. In Hong Kong this is apparently not the case,\" Tse said.\n\"They say they represent Hong Kong and Hong Kong people but they are not elected. How can they represent us if they are not elected? What is an election with 400 appointees?\"",

A chance for a lie-in, a family gathering at a restaurant -- a day off from work.\nWith just 100 days to go, Hong Kong is awash in a sea of differing emotions.\nSome, like the street revellers, are delighted that more than 150 years of Chinese humiliation is about to end.\n\"This is a grand and great occasion. In just 100 days, we will return to the Chinese motherland,\" said chief organiser Raymond Wu as the revellers gathered in Victoria Park -- named after the queen who reigned when Britain, at the height of its imperial powers, wrested Hong Kong from China's weak and crumbling Qing dynasty in the mid-19th century.\n\"We welcome the washing away of over a century of humiliation and shame,\" Wu said to a burst of applause.\nOthers fret, particularly the pro-democracy camp, about their future under a China that has already put in place plans to dilute civil liberties and dissolve the elected legislative council -- undoing democratic reforms spearheaded by Patten.\nA handful of demonstrators, their mouths taped shut in what they said was a symbol of things to come, took up position around the base of Queen Victoria's statue and held up placards condemning China's brutal military crackdown on student-led demonstrators around Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June 1989.\nMany people are simply keeping their fingers crossed.\nBut Hong Kong, as it enters the last leg of its drawn out transition from British colony to Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China, has defied those who forecast a society in chaos, of panic, economic collapse and deserted buildings.\nPatten said Hong Kong had reached this moment in its history in first class condition.\nHe cited a poll conducted earlier this month by the 1997 Transition Project at Hong Kong's Baptist University that found that 90 percent of the people here were happy with life.\nPatten said the views that Hong Kong would quickly adjust to the rolling back of freedoms or of more authoritarian government were dubious.\n\"Hong Kong is, as I said recently, a smoothly functioning community. It's like a Rolls Royce,\" Patten said.\n\"All you need to do if you're in charge is to slip into the driving seat, switch on the ignition and away you go.\n\"I don't quite see the point of lifting the bonnet to tinker with the engine. That only raises worries about whether it will work so well, and whether you may be persuaded by some people to start stripping it down for spare parts.\"",

Experts say refined oil product consumption will rise to 4.2 million bpd in 2000 and 6.8 million bpd in 2010 from 3.07 million bpd in 1995.\nThe world's sixth largest oil producer, China became a net oil importer in 1993 when brisk economic development outpaced domestic oil output, which is burdened by ageing oilfields and a lack of new discoveries.\nWhile attempts are being made to locate new fields, Beijing has also given a clear mandate for refineries, particularly those along the coast and in big cities, to expand their capacities and upgrade to produce cleaner, more environmentally friendly products.\nThere are also indications that primary oil refining expansion will be accompanied by upgrading secondary petrochemical plants.\n\"The code is now \"oil and chemical'. Based on experiences of the oil industry elsewhere, such an approach is more realistic, comprehensive,\" said a senior official with the Fujian refinery, in the southeastern province of Fujian.\nChina's biggest refinery, Yanshan in Beijing, plans to increase its 9.5 million tonnes per year capacity to 10 million tonnes before 2000, a senior official told Reuters.\nEthylene production, which has been expanded from 300,000 tonnes per year to 450,000 tonnes per year since September 1994, will be increased to 600,000 tonnes during the same period, she said.\nIn Fujian, the 2.5 million tonnes per year refinery will be expanded to 4.0 million tonnes by 1997. Talks are also underway with foreign investors to expand capacity further to 8.0 million tonnes per year and build an ethylene plant of 600,000 tonnes capacity, a Fujian official said.\nFierce bidders for the 10 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) joint venture plan are Amoco Corp and Exxon Corp.\nYangzi refinery in Nanjing in Jiangsu province plans to raise capacity to 8.0 million tonnes from 5.5 million tonnes per year, a senior refinery official said.\nIt signed a letter of intent with BASF AG in March to build an integrated petrochemical site. The 50-50 joint venture, worth 50 billion yuan ($6 billion), has 16 plants, one of which is a 600,000 tonnes per year ethylene facility.\n(US$1 = 8.3 yuan)",

We have a long-term investment plan,\" he said.\nBut staying power of the company, which employs some 3,500 people in the region, might just be starting to pay off having captured 75 percent of market share there.\nGrowing foreign investments by its clients in the more mature economies of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as well as the CIS have meant more business, Davies said.\nAnd in places like the former Yugoslavia where basic infrastructure and services were not well in place, delivery services were seen as particularly critical, he said.\nThe company has invested some US$46 million through expanding facilities and aircraft purchases in 1996 for Eastern and Central Europe and topped off another seven percent of the amount in training.\nIt now operates in 165 locations in the region and would add another 35 stations in 1997, Davies said.\n\"We have invested much, especially in the countryside and the next stage would be expansion of facilities,\" he said.",

Tung Chee-hwa received the majority vote of 320,\" said senior Chinese envoy Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office.\nPreparatory Committee Vice Chairman Wang Hanbin urged delegates to show their support for China's endorsement of Tung.\n\"If you don't have any objection, then approve it by applauding,\" Wang said, prompting the delegates, who include some of Hong Kong's top business leaders, to begin clapping.\nIn a meeting with reporters later, Tung reiterated his hope that Anson Chan, Hong Kong's popular chief secretary and head of the civil service, would stay on as his deputy.\n\"I haven't decided on my deputy, I hope Anson Chan will stay and I hope she can be my deputy,\" Tung said.\nTung said he would also work closely with the current British-led government to promote Hong Kong in the final months of colonial rule and ensure a smooth transition.\nTung's selection was met with scuffles, anger and apathy on Wednesday in Hong Kong, where pro-democracy activists and politicans denounced the selection process as undemocratic and condemned the magnate's appointment.\nIn addition to endorsing Tung's appointment on behalf of the Beijing government, Thursday's Preparatory Committee meeting in Shenzhen will also discuss a package of procedures for establishing a provisional legislature on December 21 that will replace Hong Kong's elected chamber with the handover.\nThe legislature plan has been strongly opposed by Hong Kong pro-democracy groups, which see it as a move to crush freedom and introduce repressive laws.\nAn official said the gathering was also expected to discuss a move by Britain to introduce a lenient anti-subversion law in Hong Kong before the handover. A Preparatory Committee legal sub-group has recommended repealing the British law.\nTung has said he would take a hard line against meddling by provincial Chinese bosses who may disregard Beijing's edict that Hong Kong be a Special Administrative Region of China with considerable autonomy in governing its own affairs.\nHong Kong's Economic Times newspaper said China was expected to rank the future chief executive as equal to a state councillor.\nThis position, one level below vice-premier, would mean he outranks provincial governors and will help discourage interference in Hong Kong affairs by regional cadres, it said.",

Double Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher, and current Formula One champion Damon Hill are past Macau competitors.\nChina also insists it is not seeking to edge Macau out of hosting international motor racing.\n\"We won't affect Macau.

Revenue growth was also better than expected.  \n\"I think the most impressive was the revenue growth,\" said Stephen Dube, a Wasserstein Perrella analyst. \"It's coming from all other products except for mainframes.\" As expected, IBM said its mainframe revenues fell in the quarter.\nPreviously, IBM had expected that currency and memory chip prices would have a diminished impact on the second half.\nBut Monday, IBM said it could have a slightly bigger negative impact from currency rates than the $0.08 a share it saw in the third quarter and memory prices would continue to hurt its semiconductor business, comments that had a dampening effect on analysts hoping for a very strong fourth quarter.  \nAnalysts still expect IBM to report a strong fourth quarter, because many other products are doing well and it will also begin to see sales of its recently shipped models of its lower-cost mainframes. But they also need to account for IBM's comments that it will begin spreading out some of its mainframes sales over several quarters.\nG. Richard Thoman, IBM's chief financial officer, told Wall Street that a \"growing proportion\" of IBM's mainframes sales are going through its computer services business, and therefore, IBM will not see the full sales in a quarter for all its machines.  \n\"If you sell a mainframe for $100,000 and you lease it or it's on a services contract ... rather than $100,000 at once, you have $8,000 a quarter,\" Thoman said in an interview, adding that this is \"just an example.\"\nThoman buoyed analysts with news that IBM's mainframe installations, which grew 25 perent, are growing \"almost back to 1980s\" levels. But even with such strong customer interest, IBM's prices are still so low that revenues are still expected to decline, while mainframe profits are forecast to be hefty.\n\"This quarter it did not come from mainframes,\" said Stephen Dube, a Wasserstein Perella Securities analyst.\n\"Mainframes are not a growth area for them,\" he said. But mainframes are still IBM's second most profitable hardware product, after its AS/400 minicomputers.\nThe fourth quarter was also marred by a prediction that IBM will take a bigger-than-expected restructuring cost. Originally, IBM had predicted about $200 million per quarter this year, but said on Monday that it will spend an additional $100 million to $200 million in the fourth quarter.\nIBM said the increase resulted from more employees taking its voluntary buyout plan in Europe in the fourth quarter.",

        "Text": "Electronic commerce over the Internet - buying airplane tickets, music CDs, or clothes with a credit card - is not fiction anymore.\nBut security and other concerns hampered the Internet from becoming an international shopping mall in 1996, and security remains an issue for 1997.\nElectronic commerce in 1996 was not quite as robust as some firms had anticipated, as delays in developing the software to secure credit card transactions on the Net kept merchants and consumers at bay. E-commerce is still in its infancy and likely to explode toward the end of the century.\n\"This was kind of a building year,\" said Scott Smith, a Jupiter Communications analyst. \"Many consumers are just starting to get online, merchants are trying to still figure out how to present themselves online.\"\nAccording to Jupiter, total revenues generated from all consumer shopping over the Internet and online services will reach about $1.2 billion in 1996. The revenues are expected to almost double next year, to $2.3 billion.\nJupiter, a New York market research firm, forecasts 1999 revenues to jump to $5.5 billion and to $7.3 billion in 2000.\nTravel and the direct distribution of electronic products, such as PCs, software, etc., are the two biggest categories of electronic commerce right now, Smith said, with travel making up about half of the $1.2 billion in 1996 commerce revenues.\nMost of the giant retailers are sitting by the sidelines, watching and waiting for the security to be in place and to see what some of the catalog merchants and other more daring retailers are doing on the Internet, where there are many opportunities to save costs, keep inventories low and target customers with specific products aimed at their profiles.\n\"It's inventing whole new ways of selling stuff,\" said Irving Wladawsky-Berger, the head of International Business Machines Corp.'s Internet division.\nIBM has developed a shopping mall called World Avenue, where mostly speciality retailers have storefronts.It also includes Express, the popular unit of Limited Inc.\nBut still, Internet shopping is not viewed by consumers as completely safe. A recent study by O'Reilly & Associates of Sebastopol, Calif., reported that fewer than 1 percent of all public World Wide Web sites are fully able to host secure transactions.\n\"It's easy enough to know that if you get a warning from your browser that what you are about to do is dangerous...that this is a deterrant,\" said Richard Peck, a vice president at O'Reilly \"Commerce readiness is an issue of consumer trust, confidence.\"\nCredit card companies MasterCard International and Visa International have been working together since last February on software to secure credit card transactions, using data encryption (scrambling) techniques and authentication software to ensure identities of the consumer, the merchant and the Web site.\nBut the software development is behind, analysts and industry executives said, even though the protocols (the roadmap for software developers) called the SET (secure electronic transaction) specification have been published.\nThe companies had said in February they expected banks to be able to offer secure bankcard services via the Internet to their cardholders in the fourth quarter 1996.\n\"They have totally blown that deadline out of the water,\" Smith of Jupiter said. \"There was a bit of hype about it originally that made people think it would be done really fast.\" Smith said the development has many diverse layers.\n\"There are issues that have to be sorted out. It probably won't be until 1998 when it is fully implemented,\" Smith said.\nVisa did not return a call seeking comment. A spokesman for MasterCard in Purchase, N.Y. said that the companies remain \"on track\" with their original timeframes, but that MasterCard had no news since a recent announcement.\nLast month, MasterCard purchased 51 percent of Mondex International Inc., a leading electronic payment system using a payment card called a smart card, which are like electronic wallets. A group of banks and AT&T endorsed the electronic cash card, with pilot testing already going on in some cities.\nSmart cards will likely become one of the many ways consumers pay for purchases online. PCs will have built-in smart card readers, specifically designed for online buys.\nSo while the SET software is still in development, companies are finding other ways to do transactions.\nCyberCash, which is also a partner working on the SET transaction system, is providing encryption software for America Online Inc's Web hosting service, so that small or large companies selling goods can have a secure credit card payment system, based on data encryption software currently available.\n\"SET isn't really all there yet,\" said Doug McKee, manager of Web server development at AOL. \"Cybercash has a system that is like a proprietary version of SET...I don't think there is a reason to wait.\"\nSome companies are not waiting. While the big retail giants slowly enter cyberspace, a new breed of Internet retailers and brands are being born, like Amazon.com, the popular site bookseller and Onsale.com, an auction house for computers and consumer electronics goods.",

        "Text": "International Business Machines Corp is discontinuing some unspecified research and development projects as part of a wider effort to cut costs, Louis Gerstner, the company's chairman and chief executive, said on Wednesday.\nGerstner, speaking on a panel of top IBM executives at a Gartner Group technology symposium, said IBM would cut projects for products and services it thought customers would not  want. The move is part of a reallocation of the company's $6.0 billion research budget for 1996, he said.  \n\"Are the dogs eating the dog food,\" Gerstner asked. \"Is the customer liking this stuff?\"\nPreviously, he said, IBM cut overhead expenses from its research projects. He said that on Monday he sat down with several top IBM executives and painstakingly reviewed the company's entire research and development program.\n\"We have been able to cut overhead,\" Gerstner said. \"A lot of what has been done in the past was cutting duplication....We are now at the point where we are cutting projects.\"  \nGerstner took over IBM in April 1993 and quickly embarked on a massive cost-cutting program.\n\"We spend $6 billion in research. That just happens to be equal to Microsoft's revenues,\" Gerstner said.\nHe said the company had moved about 20 percent of the R&D budget to its networked computing research.\nIn 1995, IBM spent a total of $6.01 billion on research.\nGerstner declined to be more specific about what projects IBM decided to halt. But he stressed that IBM was discontinuing \"projects\" -- not products that IBM's customers depend on. \"I don't want to start any rumors here,\" he said.  \nAnalysts said Gerstner was likely trying to prevent any possible misinterpretation of his comments and stop any speculation that IBM was cutting research on products already on the market, such as its much-maligned OS/2 Warp operating system.\n\"Some industry solutions will go away,\" said Gary Helmig, a SoundView Financial analyst, referring to projects aimed at specific industries, such as travel. He declined to speculate any further on what projects IBM was cutting.\n\"We used to develop solutions country by country,\" said Nick Donofrio, an IBM senior vice president, who was on the Gartner conference panel.  \nWhen asked why IBM remained in the unprofitable home PC business, executives said the potential of the $60 billion market -- which may grow to $100 billion by 2000 -- was too rich to ignore. A second reason is that IBM is able to leverage its development and manufacturing of corporate PCs, they said.\n\"We are not doing this just so we can put a box in the home,\" said Robert Stephenson, a senior IBM vice president in charge of the PC business. \"I hope that we will (eventually) have a server in every home.\"  \n\"We can make a profit,\" Stephenson added.\nIndustry analysts have said the home PC business is the least profitable segment of the market. Indeed, many companies are losing money, they say.",

Prodigy says it currently has 1 million households, or about 1.6 million total members. But some analysts dispute these figures, saying it has fewer members.\nProdigy also announced a licensing deal with privately held Progressive Networks to provide Real Audio technology to be integrated with Prodigy Internet. Real Audio software enables users to listen to music and other audio material on the Net.\nProdigy also said that its Africa Online unit is now providing Internet access in Ivory Coast as well as in Kenya.\nProdigy said its Internet service is designed to work with two leading Web browsers, Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Explorer and Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator, but Internet Explorer is its preferred browser through a cross-distribution pact announced last week.\nThe online service, formerly a joint venture owned by International Business Machines Corp. and Sears Roebuck Corp., is now owned by a group of private investors, including Grupo Carso, a leading Mexican industrial company.\nIn July, the privately held investor group, called International Wireless, merged with Prodigy. The group's founders, Greg Carr and Delacey, are now at the helm of Prodigy. Carr is chairman of Prodigy Inc.",

Tuesday unveiled a line of low-cost software to make corporate networks more like the Internet and said that it would \"embrace\" archrival Microsoft Corp.'s products as part of its war for control of the corporate software market.\nNetscape is under heavy attack from software behemoth Microsoft, which is seeking to wrestle away some of Netscape's dominant share in both Internet and intranet software.\nThe Mountain View, Calif.-based upstart has about 80 percent of the Internet browser software arena with its Navigator software and between 60 percent to 70 percent of the exploding \"intranet\" market.\nA corporate \"intranet\" is a computer network designed around Internet technology and open standards.\nAs part of its plan to try to hold onto its lead and to gain entree to more companies, Netscape unveiled several products for the corporate market and said it was \"embracing\" Microsoft applications software and its operating systems because many potential customers rely on Microsoft products.\n\"We are very hard-core about ... fitting into our customers' 'legacy' systems,\" Marc Andreessen, co-founder and senior vice president of technology at Netscape, told a news conference, in one of many jabs at Microsoft.\n\"Legacy systems\" is a term in the industry that usually refers to the established, older technology running a corporation, such as mainframe computers.\nNetscape stock dipped 62.5 cents to $44.25, while Microsoft rose $2.25 to $138.875 on Nasdaq.\nNetscape announced several new intranet products, including new software incorporating the latest upgrade of its popular Navigator Web browser, Version 4.0, and priced them way below similar offerings by both Microsoft and Lotus Development Corp., Netscape said.\nOne new software product, Netscape Communicator, combines Navigator and other components: Composer, to create documents in the hypertext markup language (HTML) used on the Internet's World Wide Web; Messenger, an electronic mail application; Collabra group discussion software; and the Netscape Inbox Direct service, which delivers messages and news stories to an e-mail address daily at no extra cost.\nNetscape Communicator will replace the current Navigator software for consumers. Communicator is priced at $49 for the standard version and $79 for the professional edition, per user.\nNetscape expects to make Communicator available by next year's first quarter for 17 major computer operating systems, including Windows 95, Windows 3.1 and Apple's Macintosh.\nUsers of Navigator 3.0 who have purchased a subscription will receive an upgrade to Communicator at no charge.\nNetscape also introduced an upgrade of its SuiteSpot software, which manages the server computers that run corporate networks.\nSuiteSpot is priced at $57,900 for 1,000 users. This compares with prices of $73,590 to $279,590 for competing products from Microsoft and Lotus, Netscape said.\nNetscape also unveiled an initiative to help corporate users make it easier to use its software with core Microsoft products, such as its Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems and Microsoft Office with Netscape products.\nAnalysts said Netscape is trying to appeal to a whole new group of corporations by enabling its software to run with the huge installed base of Microsoft-based PCs and servers.\n\"The strategy is not to scare away the IT (information technology) managers,\" said Eric Brown, a Forrester Research analyst.\nNetscape's not-so-friendly bear hug of Microsoft is part of the David-and-Goliath war with Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft, the world's No. 1 software company, for control of the Web browser market and more importantly, control of the corporate network. Netscape already derives 80 percent of it revenues from sales of intranet software.\nBut Netscape acknowledged it may lose some share in the future intranet software market, which Forrester Research is forecasting to reach $10 billion by 2000.\n\"Dominance is hard to measure,\" Andreessen said in an interview. \"I think we can get at least 50 percent of the intranet software market in five years.\"\nAccording to a recent Hambrecht & Quist survey of 200 companies, Netscape now has about 60 percent of corporate intranets, Microsoft's BackOffice has 30 percent and International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus Notes 10 percent.\nNetscape's Navigator software has created a huge brand name and a \"calling card,\" giving it entree to major  corporations. Now the company must execute its strategy and build a sales infrastructure, Andreessen said, a major challenge as its growth continues to explode.\nThe company, which went public in August 1995, is expected to grow to about 1,700 employees by year-end, up from about 400 at the time of its initial public offering, Andreessen said.\nAndreessen added that Netscape has not abandoned its consumer focus in favor of the corporate user.\nNetscape also signed deals with more than 70 manufacturing partners, including Apple Computer Inc., Compaq Computer Corp., Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., International Business Machines Corp., Ing. C. Olivetti & C. SpA, Siemens Nixdorf and Sun Microsystems Inc.",

Revenue growth was also better than expected.\n\"I think the most impressive was the revenue growth,\" said Stephen Dube, an analyst with Wasserstein Perrella.\nWhile mainframe computers no longer generate sales growth for Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM, they remain one of the company's important profit centres.\nThoman told analysts that more of IBM's mainframes sales were coming through its computer services business, and that IBM will not see the full impact of sales in one quarter for its new machines.\n\"If you sell a mainframe for $100,000 and you lease it or it's on a services contract ... rather than $100,000 at once, you have $8,000 a quarter,\" Thoman said in an interview, citing an example.\nThe company said revenues were higher in North America, Asia and Latin America but were flat in Europe. Revenue at its services division grew 26 percent to $3.9 billion, IBM said.\nTotal hardware sales rose 8 percent to $8.4 billion. PC sales, AS/400 minicomputers, and storage systems were up, while RS/6000 work stations, mainframes, and semiconductors fell.\nIBM said pricing pressures hurt its semiconductor business.\nSoftware revenues were off 1 percent to $3.1 billion, largely due to a decline in host-based software, which runs on mainframes. Distributed software revenues grew significantly from the 1995 period. Maintenance revenues fell 7 percent to $1.8 billion.",

IBM will also announce a partnership with Charles Schwab Corp, the discount brokerage firm that has already been very active in developing online brokerage and trading services. But it is not yet clear whether or not IBM will make much money from services and transactions, of which it will get a piece.  \nFor example, in its World Avenue consumer retailing site on the Internet, IBM receives a start-up fee from its vendors and it gets a five percent commission from its retailing partners on sales and a monthly maintentance charge.\n\"What they are trying to do is build a recurring revenue stream,\" said John Jones of Salomon Brothers. \"They are trying to get into as many aspects of network computing as they can.\"\nSome analysts said that, of all IBM's electronic commerce ventures, the World Avenue site is the least likely to succeed, because it does not add a great deal of value, other than the convenience of not leaving your home to shop.\n\"Malls on the Internet are not what people want,\" said Forrester's Dolberg. \"If they want a mall, they want products grouped together by categories, say like shoes, so they can comparison shop...The Internet itself is like a whole mall, where a lot of different things are already grouped together.\"\nOther recent Internet shopping mall efforts have failed, such as MCI Communications Corp's MCI Marketplace.\nIBM is hoping its technology such as Net.Commerce and Net.Commerce Payment software, will provide an easy-to-use and secure way of conducting credit card transactions and help end consumer fears about using credit cards over the Internet.",

Because of this feature, Java has become a popular programming language for the Internet and networked computers.\n\"Let's not blow this,\" Gerstner said. \"Let's not do to Java what the industry did to Unix,\" the high-performance operating system which splintered off into more than 20 versions.\nAt Internet World on Wednesday, Sun Microsystems unveiled an alliance with IBM and other major companies, which are all backing a move to standardise and certify one version of the Java language.\n\"Gerstner is taking his guidance from customers and not from industry conflicts,\" said Sam Albert, an industry consultant based in Scarsdale, N.Y. \"He did a lot to de-hype the industry.\"\nGerstner also reiterated his plea that the industry make things easier for users. He showed a video of IBM's voice recognition technology, which enables computer users to give simple commands to surf the World Wide Web.\nHe said IBM's voice recognition software for the Internet is now available in beta, or experimental form, and that users could download it for free, starting Wednesday, from IBM's Web site, http://www.ibm.com.",

        "Text": "Sun Microsystems Inc. Tuesday introduced its first network computer, the JavaStation, in a direct challenge to Microsoft and Intel, the dominant players in the industry.\nSaying the company was ushering in a new era of computing, Sun Chief Executive Officer Scott McNealy unveiled a sleek, charcoal-grey device, about nine inches by 12 inches, with no disk drives or slots or floppy disks, to allow access to networks of computers and the Internet, at a cost of $742.\nSun, Oracle Corp., and International Business Machines Corp. are challenging the computer industry's dominant \"Wintel\" architecture from Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. with the new low-cost, low-maintenance network computers, or \"NCs.\"\n\"Today you'll see why the network is the computer and has been since 1984,\" McNealy said, reiterating Sun's mantra.\nThe JavaStation is targeted at businesses. Sun said the machines might eventually be offered into the consumer market by cable TV and telecommunications firms as Internet access devices, but it declined to say when that might happen.\nWith Java, software applications can be written in one language and distributed across networks and diverse computers and computing environments, from mainframes to minicomputers to personal computers and now to the new NCs.\n\"Java computing is going to be as powerful as the mainframe in the '60s, the minicomputer in the '70s and the PC environment of the '80s,\" said Ed Zander, president of Sun Micro's Computer Co.\nSun introduced three versions of the JavaStation. The lowest cost, $742 version does not include a monitor or a keyboard. The systems are aimed at corporate users of Sun workstations and host computers, but can also access Microsoft PC applications from a host computer running Windows NT.\nAt a news conference in New York, Sun executives said they did not expect the new machines to take the place of personal computers, but they also professed amazement at the news conference Microsoft held Monday.\nMicrosoft, with several major players in the PC industry, unveiled its own \"NetPC\" strategy aimed at driving down the cost of PC ownership, with new features in Windows for network management, calling it \"Zero Administration.\"\n\"I have never seen such totally reactive vapour,\" Zander told reporters. \"We must really have touched a nerve.\"\nMcNealy said it was simply a move by the \"old-line legacy Wintel\" trying to hold onto its position in the world. Wintel refers to the combination of Microsoft operating systems and Intel chips.\n\"People call it a PC on a diet, I call it a PC in a corset, with the strings pulled too tight and a bright red face,\" McNealy said, referring to the Microsoft initiative.\nBut even with all the hype surrounding the industry's latest infatuation, Sun executives and analysts were not expecting big sales of the NC, nor will the JavaStation become a big percentage of Sun's hardware sales.\n\"This thing is a small percentage of the total product environment, it will help sell more servers,\" Zander told Reuters.\n\"Maybe a couple of years from now it will begin competing with low-end PCs,\" said Evan Quinn at International Data Corp., noting Sun's network computing strategy is tied to future expansion of its Java technology.\nSun said the entry level model, containing eight megabytes of memory, will ship beginning in December. A fully configured system, which includes memory, keyboard, a mouse and 14-inch monitor, will cost $995.\nThe company also said it will offer a JavaStation with 16 megabytes of memory, a mouse, keyboard and a 17-inch monitor for $1,565. The JavaStation also has a small operating system, the Java OS, taking up less than three megabytes of memory.\nWhile the devices are lower cost than the typical PC, which can range in cost from $1,500 to $3,000, Sun executives said their customers will save money as the costs of PC ownership for businesses escalate and are now estimated at anywhere from $6,000 to $12,000 a year, per PC.\nSun said a JavaStation costs about $2,500 a year to maintain, or about $7,500 for three years, potentially saving corporations millions of dollars.",

Otherwise, he asked, \"Why would IBM give a heads up for a product that isn't ready until March?\"\nIBM's current line of workstations, the RS/6000 family, are designed around IBM's PowerPC chip and run on the UNIX operating system. In its third-quarter earnings report, however, IBM said its workstation business was flat, another indicator of the increasingly popularity of the lower-cost NT-based machines.\nCompaq is expected to introduce three models in the $5,000 to $10,000 range, IDC's Seymour said. A Compaq spokeswoman declined to comment on the products to be unveiled Tuesday.\nPC Week, an industry trade magazine, reported last week that Compaq will price its entry-level workstation at $5,000, targeted to molecular modeling and computer-aided design.\nTwo other models, for the animation creation business, are priced from $8,000 to $10,000, PC Week said.\nAs part of its recent product revamp, Silicon Graphics Inc., long a leader in the animiation workstation area, also recently introduced a less-expensive model called the O2, which runs on UNIX, in response to the growth in the NT-based machines.\nBut analysts said SGI and Sun Micro will not likely embrace the Microsoft operating system NT anytime soon, even though it is poised to become the faster-growing workstation segment.\n\"Sun and SGI would rather die than do NT,\" said Seymour. \"That's the unfortunate thing ... At some point, the NT market share is going to be bigger than theirs.\"",

But on Monday, it succumbed with its own flat rate $19.95 a month, and it will discontinue its direct Internet access, called GNN.  \nCase and other AOL executives highlighted to shareholders how the company will see new sources of revenue from advertising and merchandising and how one area of its new business will be running on a cable industry model, with more revenues from advertising than subscriber fees.\n\"Increasingly, we are evolving where we depend less on subscriber revenue and increasingly on advertising and other sources,\" said Lennert Leader, the company's chief financial officer.  \nOne of the areas from which the company expects this growth to come is its new unit AOL Networks, headed by former MTV executive Bob Pittman, to oversee AOL's flagship online service.  The other two units in AOL's reorganization are its AOL Studios, to create content for its service and ANS Communications, to manage the core network infrastructure.\nPittman said he expects that in the future, over 50 percent of AOL's revenues will come from advertising and other revenue sources, such as merchandising the AOL brand name, through books, television, etc.  \n\"To me, it looks very similar to the cable network business,\" Pittman said, adding that in the early days of Viacom Inc's MTV network, subscriber revenue was greater than advertising revenue.  \"Our growth curve looks very similar to the cable business.  Ad revenue is growing faster than subsciber revenues.\"\nPittman said he plans to \"ride the tremendous wave\" of AOL's brand recognition for new sources of revenue growth, for which he said there are multi-levels of possibilities. One area, he mentioned after his second day on the job, is the catalog business, which can move to electronic shopping.  \nShareholders, some of whom said the stock has been a very good investment because of its many stock splits, said they were pleased with AOL's recent actions, in particular the measure to restructure accounting methods.\n\"The fact that they are getting a more straightforward accounting system is a step in the right direction,\" said David Ryan, a retired shareholder from the Washington, D.C. area. \"Their financial statements were hard to understand. It's more straightforward now.\"  Ryan said the stock has split three times since he has owned it in the past four or five years.  \nAOL said on Monday that it will now expense all its marketing costs, which includes the hefty subscriber acquisition costs, as they are incurred, instead of deferring those costs over time.\nTo reflect those immediate changes, AOL is taking a $385 million restructuring charge in the September quarter, to account for the balance of its deferred subscriber acquisition costs.  AOL CFO Leader also told the meeting that the cost to acquire new subscribers will be lower in the future, as AOL depends less on sending out floppy disks, and as AOL comes with more new PCs.\n\"The good news is the growth is accelerating,\" Case said. \"We have taken the step of expensing the marketing and we can avoid some of the debates about the earnings.\"",

But as Compaq has quickly grown to an almost $18 billion company in recent years, Pfeiffer said he needs another executive to stay in touch with the day-to-day activities of its worldwide sales and support organization.\n\"Fifteen people have been reporting to me up until this morning when we announced this change,\" Pfeiffer said. \"That is a huge top management organization. As the company grows, my tasks change.\"\nCompaq has grown from its origins as one of the first companies to successfully clone the IBM PC in the early 1980s to become the leading PC maker in the world. Cooley is known for his strong relationships with the PC sales channel and his role in building Compaq's massive distribution.\n\"My feelings in joining pcOrder are similar to those I had in joining Compaq almost 13 years ago,\" Cooley said in a statement. \"Back then, I saw the irrefutable logic of the PC as a new paradigm in computing. Today, I believe pcOrder's technology and vision represent an irrefutable value proposition.\"\nBefore joining Compaq in 1984, Cooley held several sales and marketing positions at International Business Machines Corp., where he worked for 18 years.\n\"Getting Cooley is really a coup for pcOrder,\" said John McCarthy, a Forrester Research analyst, adding that Cooley's connections in PC distrubution will give pcOrder more credibility as it builds its system. Cooley's acceptance of $1 a year for salary, plus stock options, is also a \"big bet on the company's upside (potential),\" McCarthy said.\npcOrder for now is still private, but the company is contemplating a public offering eventually.\n\"We do not have a set plan or a set timetable, but we are seriously considering it,\" said founder and President Christina Jones. Jones will continue as president of pcOrder. The post of chairman and CEO had been vacant since the start-up was founded in June.\npcOrder.com is a marketplace on the Internet, where PC makers, components makers and distributors list information and receive orders.\nCurrently, sales representatives and customers user pcOrder to configure build-to-order PCs, compare prices, and place orders over the Internet.

PCs are expected to break-even.  \n\"I think it will be a good quarter,\" said Steve Milunovich, a Morgan Stanley analyst. \"The dollar did strengthen at the end of the quarter. You will generally see numbers near consensus.\"\nAnalysts said they expect IBM's earnings to be a bit better than expected, but that its expenses for headcount reductions will be greater than the previous quarters.\n\"Europe remains a slower grower, which has led to a number of organizational and planned efficiency changes,\" said John Jones, a Salomon Brothers analyst.

Profits have been hit by the weak Mexican peso, tough trading conditions in the mature markets of Europe and America and de-stocking in the United States.  \nThe consensus forecast for the total dividend is 23.6p.\nAllied sold its share in C-T to Bass in August for 200 million in cash together with its beer brands, allowing the group to quit brewing and concentrate entirely on its spirits and retailing businesses.\nAllied said at the time it expected a loss on the sale of C-T of about 320 million stg.\nAfter tax the company said it would mean a reduction in reserves of some 200 million stg.  \nAt Allied Domecq Spirits and Wines, many analysts are predicting a 60 million drop in trading profits from the 488 million stg recorded in 1995. Stock reduction and weak markets dented profits at the division in the first half, too.\nIn the United States where trade stocks of four major brands -- Kahlua, Beefeater, Courvoisier and Canadian Club -- built up last year, Allied was forced to start reducing stock levels by half a million cases which it expected to complete by the end of August 1996.\nSome analysts think this de-stocking will strip 40 million stg off operating profits from the group's spirits arm.  \nTrading profits from Allied's spirits and wine division dropped to 258 million stg for the six months ended February 29 from 327 million.\n\"Spirits will continue to show that things are tough although we are now seeing price increases of two to three percent coming in for the industry as a whole,\" said Mark Puleikis, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.\nAllied's retailing division, which includes managed pubs as well as Baskin-Robbins and Dunkin' Donuts, is expected to post only a slight improvement in profits of some eight million to 223 million.  \n\"Although the managed pub side will improve, let's say it will add about about 12 million pounds to give 127 million at an operating level, Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin Robbins will drag the division down,\" said one analyst who declined to be named.\nIn franchising, poor winter weather held back same-store sales growth particularly in Baskin-Robbins during the first half.\nCarlsberg-Tetley is forecast to chip in trading profits of some 65 million at the year-end up from 61 million. In the six months to 29 February 1996 it made trading profits of 25 million, an increase of 14 percent on the same half last year.  \nAttention will focus on what management has to say about continued pressure from the investment community for a demerger of Allied's spirits division.\nAllied shares touched a five-month high of 492p on Friday. \"Obviously people are hoping there will be some news on a demerger,\" said one analyst who chose not to be named.\n\"A trading demerger would really add value to the group. The City has obviously done its sums and worked out it is worth about five pounds on a post-demerger basis,\" said another.\nA Reuter poll of 24 brokers shows a consenus forecast for earnings per share of 33.7p rising to 37.4 next year.",

The results beat analysts' forecasts which ranged from 760 million pounds to 820 million.\n\"I think there is quite a lot of momentum in Unilever and that is before the benefits of management reorganisation which began in September,\" said Lang.\nBefore an exceptional charge of 32 million pounds, mostly to reshape its newly acquired industrial cleaning business Diversey, pretax profits rose six percent to 918 million.\n\"The total charges were clearly lower than we expected,\" said Richard Newboult, an analyst at Lehman Brothers who forecast a total restructuring charge of 74 million with about half of that related to Diversey.\nDiversey, acquired in January from Canadian brewer Molson for 360 million pounds, was merged with Lever Industrial in October to form a combined business with annual turnover of 1.15 billion and a workforce of 13,000 in 60 countries.\nUnilever owns a range of household brands including washing detergent OMO, Brooke Bond tea, Ponds cosmetic cream and several ice-cream products.\n\"Although poor weather had a negative effect on icecream sales, other parts of the business in Europe did well,\" said Unilever press officer Mike Haines.\nAnalysts and stockmarket dealers agreed. Despite the impact of a dull summer on ice-cream sales and profits, Unilever still managed to improve its profit by 13 million pounds to 502 million in the three month period from improved profits in detergents, frozen foods and personal products.\n\"The real strength came from the emerging markets of Latin America and Asia Pacific and the strong underlying performance in North America,\" added Haines.\nThe Asia-Pacific region turned in a 20 million pounds increase in profits to 108 million in the third quarter, Latin America was up 14 million pounds at 79 million, while Africa and the Middle East showed a nine million rise to 56 million pounds, reflecting changes made by the group to its Nigerian business.",

Brewing is expected to contribute some 80 million stg, with 45 million of this total anticipated from Courage. Courage made just 9.0 million stg in operating profit, on turnover of 298.9 million stg, to overall group profits in the first half of 1995.\nS&N acquired Courage from Australian brewer Foster's in August, 1995 to create Britain's largest brewing group in a deal that cost about 550 million stg. Since then S&N has quickly set about reducing its brewing capacity by some 1.5 million barrels a year, initially by closing two breweries and shedding some 1,600 jobs.  \nJohn Smith's Courage is now Britain's leading ale brand.\nThe group's Center Parcs holiday resorts are expected to suffer from continued weak consumer leisure spending in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Center Parcs made operating profit of 82.0 million stg in the year to April 28, 1995 down 2.1 percent on turnover of 365.3 million. S&N's new village at Bispinger Heide in Germany was opened against a very weak economic background in July 1995 and the cost of opening was higher than the company expected.  \nPontin's, S&N's other leisure brand, made trading profits of 3.6 million, down from 4.1 million due to the sale of four sites and major refurbishment work at two others.\nThe performance of its Center Parc villages in the Netherlands and Belgium were adversely affected by a lack of consumer confidence and cut price competition from operators and it responded by investing heavily in those countries.\nAnalysts expect this trend to have carried on into the first half of the year, forcing the leisure division to report profits down some 5.0 million at 45 million.  \nThe company has three Center Parcs in Britain at Nottingham in the Midlands, East Anglia and Longleat, in the west of England. It owns two in France, one in Germany, two in Belgium and six in Holland.\nHowever, S&N's retail division, which includes the 1,600 strong chain of Chef & Brewer restaurants, should see trading profits improve by increased investment aimed at rebranding and lifting the image of some outlets.\nThe company's managed pub estate has been rebranded to include pub-cafe bars like Rat & Parrot and entertainment pubs like Big Hand Mo.  \nThe consensus of analysts forecasts for profits from the retail division rests at 88 million stg, up some 8.0 million on the first half of 1995. The division includes an estate of 740 tenanted and about 1,850 managed pubs as well as Chef & Brewer.\nThe company's shares have outperformed its peers by about eight percent since February, but started underperforming the FTSE100 index by some six percent since late September.\nThe shares were up 142p at 642 on Friday from their 500p close on January 3. Return on equity is currently running at 5.62 percent, half its 11.32 percent level in 1995, against 10.44 percent currently for Bass.  \nOperating margins have fallen to 12.27 percent from 15.46 percent in 1995.\nA Reuter poll of 23 brokers estimates produced a consensus estimate EPS of 44.8 for the year ended April 28, 1997 rising to 49.5 for year end 1998.",

We looked at whether we should go back to being a limited range discounter, with much lower choice, and little in terms of chilled food,\" he told Reuters.\n\"But that would have meant losing nine million customers.\"  \nHe said the store closure programme would involve less than 200 job losses, as 90 percent of the staff would be redeployed in Kwik Save's remaining 900 stores.\nAbout 1,900 work in the 107 stores to be shut. \"Yes, we are confident that the provisioning is solid and appropriate. Anything more than that would have put us in the realms of big baths and contigency buckets.\"\n\"We have looked at this particularly carefully, the days of doing big bath provisioning have gone. We have looked very specifically at the stores we plan to close. We are confident it is the proper provision to take us forward.\" he said.  \nAt a news conference chief executive Graeme Bowler said the company would introduce a new range of chilled foods, health and beauty products and over the counter medicines as well as widening its existing product range.\n\"We are going for width rather than depth in brands,\" he said. Kwik Save will have 100 own-label products in its stores from the spring 1997.\n\"We are not moving away from discounting prices. It is our core proposition and we will not dilute it,\" said Bowler. \"We are not trying to be a mini-version of someone else, we want to be ourselves.\"  \n\"Kwik Save made its reputation because it sold quality products cheaply. We will not engage in selling cheap products cheaply,\" Bowler told reporters.\nStores will also be upgraded after research conducted by outside consultants Anderson Consulting, initiated in February, showed customers wanted stores to be more welcoming and easy to use, said Bowler.\nKwik Save would need to invest heavily in technology, where it was about two to three years behind the competition, said Bowler, so that, for instance, debit cards could be used at all its tills and stock levels could be better controlled.  \nHe acknowledged that the group had failed to invest enough in upgrading the fabric of its stores in previous years.\nThe new-style Kwik Save stores will be rolled out in geographical clusters over the next three years at a cost of some 300 million stg, funded from cost savings.\nThe 107 stores will be closed progressively next year.\nResearch had identified the need to beef up the management team and as a result Kwik Save has appointed a group marketing director and a supply chain director, and planned to appoint a new buying director, Bowler said.  \nHe stressed the underlying performance of the group remained strong, generating sales of seven billion stg over the last two years despite fierce price pressure from superstores, and a return on capital of 20 percent in line with the industry average.",

Statistics from the MetOffice, Britain's national weather centre, show an average temperature of 15.9 degrees for the summer of 1996. The office says the South of France and Spain had just an average summer this year.\nNestle, who entered the UK market in 1992 with the purchase of the Lyons Maid brand, estimates total sales in Britain are down some 5 percent at 879 million due to the dull summer, of this hand held icecreams accounted for 489 million.\nIn Britain the all-time Summer record for Wall's still stands at 71 million portions sold during one week in the long, hot summer of 1976 -- the year when Wall's Cornetto first hit the market.\nHowever much the big fridge fillers spend on advertising and dreaming up new products it will be hard to break that record.",

Fierce price wars among rival drinks companies have also had ab affect.\nSince Matthew Clark stunned the stock market in September with a profit warning that wiped more than 290 million pounds ($466 million) off its market value, investors have badgered the group to explain how it intends to win back sales.\nIn the long-awaited statement, Matthew Clark conceded that price wars had continued and that sales of draught cider in June and July, were 10 percent lower than during last year's hot summer.

And that is about more travel, more tourism, more retired people, more affluent retired people.\"  \nWhitbread acquired health and sports club group David Lloyd Leisure for about 200 million stg and a chain of 16 Marriot hotels in Britain for about 185 million last August.\n\"We are making very good progress in our hotel business. Our profits are substantially ahead of last year and our customers are recognising the improvements that have been made to our hotels through joining up with Marriot,\" he said.\n\"The performance of the Marriot hotels we bought has improved against last year as well as the performance of Whitbread hotels that have been transferred to Marriot.\"  \nWhitbread opened about 45 new budget hotels called Travel Inns during the year to March 2 and Jarvis said they this part of the hotels arm was performing well. \"The occupancy levels we are getting in our budget hotels now are higher than they have ever been since we started out in this business,\" Jarvis said.\nHe said the Marriot company would contribute substantially to the earnings of Whitbread, even after interest payments.\n\"If we paid 185 million for Marriot, and you can work out the interest, I am saying we will make many millions beyond that in the current year. And this is the first full year we have had Marriot,\" he said.  \n\"Next year David Lloyd will be in that kind of position and I think that Pelican will be as well,\" he added.\nWhitbread announced an agreed 133 million stg bid for the Pelican Group of cafes in the UK in July.\n\"This year if you take Marriot and you take our Travel Inns we will make broadly as much money in hotels as we make in beer,\" Jarvis said.\nThe beer company reported operating profit of 44.9 million stg in 1995/96, a rise of some 4.5 million on the previous year, but just 15 percent of the company's total operating profit.  \nWhitbread's restaurants and inns division, which includes Marriot hotels, reported trading profit of 88.3 million up from 66.0 million.\nThe company is due to report half-year results on November 5.",

I've always been cautious,\" said Weston in an interview. \"It's a very bad time to forecast anything with two elections coming up -- in the United States and Britian. We have no idea how they will impact on us.\"  \nABF posted pretax profits of 430 million pounds ($704.1 million) for the year ended September 14 whereas most stockmarket forecasts had centred on 415 million.\nWorldwide sales were up 17 percent to 5.707 billion. Profits were driven by an especially strong performance from the company's retail operations in Britain and Ireland. Operating profits rose 25 percent to 69 million, with the company's supermarkets in Ireland further increasing their market share.\nPrimark, the women's textile chain, included results from One Up stores bought from Storehouse last year.  \n\"We got the fashion right. Primark has been refurbished and that improved its buying power and gave it more notice on the high street.\" In the second half Primark was more in tune with public demand, said Weston.\nABF's food manufacturing and processing operations in Britain showed an 8.0 percent sales growth to 3.11 billion pounds and a 12 percent profits increase to 282 million.\nHowever, operating profits from British Sugar fell to 183 million. British Sugar sales are limited by European community quotas and the renewed strength of the pound made imports from mainland Europe look cheaper in the second half.  \nAFB's profits from its Australia and New Zealand operations increased by 20 percent to 38 million.\nAC Humko, acquired from Kraft Foods in September 1995, chipped in its first full year of profits to ABF's north American business to help turn a 3.0 million loss in 1995 to a six million stg profit.\nAnalysts were surprised by the stronger than expected performance from ABF's milling and baking business where margins improved strongly. ABF owns the Twining group of companies, Burtons Biscuits, Allied Bakeries and an animal feed business.  \n\"They were good numbers a bit ahead of our figures, but it will be hard to match that in the current year,\" said Michael Bourke, analyst at Panmure Gordon. \"The green pound rate is likely to mean a reduction in British Sugar profits and inflation in food prices looks very subdued,\" he said.\nABF shares rose 8p to 426p on the news.\nNet cash held by the company rose by 196 million to 797 million at September 14, after spending 242 million on its assets and acquisitions during the year.\nThe company is keen to expand in the Far East and although ABF's history is one of expansion by organic growth if the oppurtunity arises it will make acquisitions, said Weston.\n\"We have been picking up acquisitions and if opportunities come along for something big then we will take it,\" he said.",

Green Giant was acquired as part of Pillsbury, GrandMet's U.S. food arm, in 1989.\nPillsbury currently produces some 75 percent of what it sells and this number will decline in the future.\nIf a product can be insulated by patent from the competition, then GrandMet would want to continue making it, said McGrath in an interview. But, if it's a bread or biscuit product, for instance, it may make economic sense to allow a third party producer in.  \n\"We would never get out of distilling whisky or blending... that is a skill which only a few highly skilled people can ensure. They know how to get the right quality, the right taste, the right balance. But, whether you need to bottle it yourself is another matte,\" McGrath said.\n\"The best example is Coca-Cola who are brand marketeers, brand owner and controllers of the concentrate. But, whether they own the processing is academic as long as they control the quality.\"  \nMcGrath paid tribute to former chairman Lord Sheppard, who stood down as chairman in March, after 21 years with the group, for transforming GrandMet into a leaner, more focused company.\nWhen Sheppard took over in 1987, he found a company with over 30 very different business which he thinned down to three: food, drinks and Burger King retailing.\nMcGrath, appointed chairman and chief executive of International Distillers and Vintners (IDV), GrandMet's spirits arm, in September 1993, brought a tough, cost-conscious urge to make Sheppard's vision work.  \nMcGrath, whose management skills stem from the shopfloor and operations rather than boardroom, separates himself from the culture of GrandMet's heady, deal-making days of the last decade when companies were carved up and sold on in droves.\n\"The view I take which the board strongly supports is concentrating on making those very expensive assets that we have acquired work highly efficiently.\"\n\"Now is the time to concentrate on organic growth very strongly supported by new brand development. We will only make minor acquisitions chiefly in emerging markets or food service in the U.S. where we can get some good returns,\" he said.\n\"What I am very much concentrating on now is taking all the action we possibly can to as rapidly as possible increase our return on capital,\" said McGrath.\n\"We are investing for the medium term and no longer for short term gain,\" he said.",

We are also very driven by the strength of sterling aginst other currencies,\" Stewart said in a telephone interview after the firm reported first half results.  \nIn the first half prices on the world commodity markets for butter, skimmed milk and bulk cream were off some 20 percent on last year's levels.\nWeakening world demand for dairy productes and the rise in sterling against the other marjor European currencies was not offset by a reduction in Northern's cost of milk.\nEden Vale Food Ingredients, which sells by-products of milk production like butter, skimmed milk powder and cream, on world commodity markets was the hardest hit of Northern's divisions.  \nOverall, however margins recovered on the company's prepared foods business rising one percentage point to 8.0 percent in the first half and there was room for further improvement in the second half, Stewart said.\n\"Our markets have been strengthening in general. We have seen stronger consumer demand, a trend we expect to continue at least until the end of our fiscal year.\"\nNorthern achieved four percent price inflation on its prepared foods in the first half, compared with zero last year, and so far consumers have not reacted to price increases by curbing their demand, said Stewart.  \nA typical pack of Northern's biscuits is now 2p higher at 51p than six months ago.\nThe impact of the beef crisis on consumers demand for beef and meat pies and in turn on Northern's operating profit should lessen in the second half to 2.0-3.0 million, said Stewart.\nSales of Northern's meat products were off 6.8 percent in the first half as shoppers continued to worry about a link between mad-cow disease and a similar brain wasting disease in humans. Northern estimated the beef crisis cost it about 3.0 million pounds in the first half.  \n\"The impact of BSE is likely to be a little less in the second half as we have put products in the market that can take the same role. We now use chicken, lamb or pork in a pie.\"\nBefore the beef crisis about 55 percent of Northern's hot pies were beef against 40 percent today. Pies are more important to Northern in the winter months of the second half year.\nCompetition in supplying milk to supermarkets remains intense but the recent erosion in prices should stop soon, said Stewart. \"The profitability of that sector is now such that people are losing money and we expect the price erosion to stop,\" he said.  \nNorthern now supplies about 33 percent of all milk in supermarkets, haing lost about two percentage points of market share in the first half.\nRobert Wiseman and fast-expanding Danish dairy products group MD Foods were especially keen on pricing of milk to supermarkets in the first half.\nOn Tuesday Unigate said its sales of milk to supermarkets fell 2.4 percent in the first half and dairy profits fell 2.9 million stg to 17.6 million due to lower prices for butter and milk powders, which Unigate estimated cost it about 4.0 million in the period.\nNorthern reported dairy profits down 27 percent at 21.6 million in the six months ended September 30.\nProfits from its prepared foods division were up 24.2 percent at 43.1 million, driven hardest by the grocery sector which benefitted from a full six month contribution from Green Isle which sells the Goodfella pizza brand.",

They must think there is a reasonable risk of that happening otherwise why have a plan B in place,\" said Ralph Findlay, finance director of Wolverhampton & Dudley Breweries.\nOn Sunday Bass confirmed details of a long-awaited deal to merge with Carlsberg-Tetley, leaving Danish brewer Carlsberg with a 20 percent stake in a merged Carlsberg-Tetley-Bass if British regulators allow the marriage to take place.\nUnder the terms of the deal, if Bass cannot combine C-T with its own brewing business within 16 months, Bass has the option to put its whole shareholding to Carlsberg and Carlsberg has an option to put 15 percent of C-T to Allied Domecq.\n\"If it doesn't work it seems plan B comes into operation. But it is by no means clear what will invoke plan B,\" Findlay said.\nBass was knocked off its perch as Britain's leading brewer last year when Scottish & Newcastle (S&N) acquired Courage from Australian brewer Fosters, giving it a 31 percent share of Britain's beer market.\nA merger of Bass and Carlsberg-Tetley would make Bass Britain's largest brewer by far with 35 percent of the market.\nBritain's competition authorities will want to find out if the deal would leave Bass and S&N too much control over beer prices and too powerful a grip in the Midlands and Yorkshire.\nRoger Young, retail director at Greenalls Group, said: \"In common with the rest of the world we are expecting a referral. Anything that takes competition out on the supply side is not good news from the point of view of the purchaser.\"\nGreenalls, owners of some 2,400 pubs, exited brewing at the end of February 1991. \"If it becomes too much for Bass to swallow then I suppose plan B swings in -- Carlsberg effectively takes over,\" he told Reuters.\nMany brewing analysts argue that the duopoly that exists in Scotland between Bass and S&N results in much higher margins for the brewers which means higher prices for drinkers.\n\"I think the supply position in the Midlands and Yorkshire is obviously something that needs to be looked at very carefully,\" said one senior source at regional brewer.\n\"Because Bass and Allied have dominated the beer supply in those areas since the Second World War.\"\n\"In those areas they are the two biggest brewers and the two biggest brewers getting together in very significant regions like that is something which has never happened before.\"\nA spokesman for the Office of Fair Trading confirmed it would look at the deal but declined to comment on whether the OFT would recommend referring it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for a full investigation.\nIndustry sources say although S&N's purchase of Courage was referred the OFT gave the company much clearer guidance on what concessions would be required to let it through.\nS&N was obliged to reduce its tied estate of pubs by 115 to 2,624. It also agreed to the early release of IEL (Intrepreneur Estates Ltd) pub tenants from a supply agreement. It had to release 500 of them by January 1996 and a further 500 by January 1997.",

Profits in the third quarter rose to 714 million from 680 million pounds.\nTrading profit from financial services rose by three percent, and profits from tobacco were seven percent ahead.\nWorldwide cigarette sales rose by three percent, although volumes were lower in the United States, a market where total industry sales were flat, the company said.\nThe growing pace of litigation claims against the company's U.S. cigarette subsidiary Brown & Williamson (B&W), and the U.S. industry in general, continues to unsettle investors and hurt B.A.T's share price.\nB.A.T shares have fallen from a high of 585 pence on February 2 to below 430 pence, shedding nearly four billion pounds from the company's stockmarket value along the way.\nBroughton said a demerger of Brown & Williamson would be \"highly destructive\" of shareholder value, adding there was \"no question\" that the board of directors was united on the issue.\nHe also played down fears over U.S. litigation. Only a few cases actually get to court although many are filed, and the company was confident of winning its appeal in the high-profile Carter case, Broughton told a meeting of company analysts.\nIn the case of Grady Carter, of Orange Park, Florida, a jury in Jacksonville ruled in August that B&W was negligent and made a dangerous and defective product. Carter smoked for 50 years until he was diagnosed with lung cancer.\nB.A.T shares have fallen sharply since the Florida court decided to award damages of $750,000 to Carter.\nLawyer Woody Wilner, who acted for Carter in the Florida case, had promised to bring one case a month, but three have been postponed until next year and one dismissed, B.A.T said.\nB.A.T was also confident of blocking the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's attempts to bring tobacco regulation into line with drugs and pharmaceuticals, said Broughton.\nIf the FDA proposals become law, cigarettes will be classified as \"medical devices\" and would have to meet rigorous safety and sales criteria.\nResponding to a recent paper in the U.S Science Magazine which claims a direct link between smoking and lung cancer at cell level, Broughton said B.A.T had no internal research which proved smoking caused lung cancer or that smoking was addictive.\n\"We have not concealed, we do not conceal and we will never conceal,\" he said. There was still a lack of understanding of the mechanisms of diseases attributed to smoking, he added.\nTurning to the business results, B.A.T said the seven percent rise in tobacco trading profit to 1.27 billion pounds was helped by strong sales growth in the Asia Pacific and the African, Middle East and Indian subcontinent regions.\nIn financial servies, B.A.T said its U.S. unit Farmers continued to have an excellent year.

That was up from 10 percent of its employees at that pay level in 1990.\n\"Do we do that because we're mean?\" Leuliette said of the falling wage rates. \"No. We did that because we have to promise our customers a 3 to 4 percent price reduction.\"\nFacing union demands for greater job security, GM must find a way for its massive Delphi Automotive Systems parts business to stay competitive in the worldwide auto supplier market.\nIn the current talks, Delphi has said 12 of its U.S. component facilities are underperforming and should not be subject to the job guarantees the UAW has received from other automakers.\nEven if it accepts the economic terms already agreed to by Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. , GM and Delphi will pay the average U.S. parts worker a base wage of nearly $19 an hour in the first year of the contract, and more than $21 in 1999, the third year of the agreement.\nAbout 42 percent of Delphi's workers are located in the United States, where the combined hourly wage and benefit cost of a UAW worker under the 1993 national agreement is about $43.\nDelphi, with 1995 revenues of $26.4 billion, is in 167 businesses around the world. Global expansion remains a focus for the company, which this year expects 35 percent of its revenues to come from customers outside of GM's North American Operations, Delphi President J.T. Battenberg said Tuesday.\nBut as Leuliette's comments indicate, the global auto supplier industry is growing increasingly competitive.\nThe worldwide hourly wage rate for assembling a labor-intensive part such as a wire harness is between $1 and $2, he estimated. More technical parts cost $10-$12 an hour. Leuliette said workers in Vietnam will earn $64 a month working 48 hours a week putting together wiring harnesses for ITT.\n\"If you are regionally competitive but not globally competitive, you will unlikely be a supplier to ITT,\" Leuliette told the gathering of suppliers in Detroit.\nITT Automotive, based in Auburn Hills, Mich., is the biggest unit within ITT Industries Inc., and one of the largest independent auto suppliers in the world.\nThe company, which has annual sales of about $5.5 billion, makes brake and chassis systems, as well as body and electrical components such as motors, actuators and wiper systems. Leuliette estimated the company's average global total wage costs at about $14 an hour.",

        "Text": "Labor lawyer James Hoffa, refusing to concede defeat in the Teamsters union presidential election nearly a week after his opponent claimed victory, called Thursday for a congressional investigation into the vote.\nHoffa on Tuesday formally asked U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to impound the ballots and initiate an FBI investigation into \"serious irregularities\" in the election.\n\"We really have what I call Teamstergate,\" Hoffa told reporters at a news conference Thursday at the Teamsters' Detroit offices, where his legendary father, the late Jimmy Hoffa, ruled the union in the 1950s and '60s.\nIncumbent Teamsters President Ron Carey on Saturday claimed victory in the hard-fought election, winning by an apparent margin of about 17,000 votes. But 41,002 ballots were set aside for further eligibility checks, and Hoffa says more than 25,000 other ballots may have disappeared.\nAfter all eligible votes were tallied late Saturday, court-appointed Election Officer Barbara Zack Quindel accounted for 485,605 mail-in ballots returned. But last week she reported that the total number of ballots received was 511,268, an estimate based on receipts from the U.S. Postal Service.\nHoffa said he wants an explanation for the discrepancy between the ballots counted and the ballots received.\n\"If I lost, I lost. I just want a fair election,\" Hoffa said.\nCarey, 60, was first elected president of the 1.4 million-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters as a reformer in 1991. His apparent re-election was lauded by AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, who had remained neutral during the campaign.\nMeanwhile, Quindel decided Wednesday to void 120 Hoffa votes after finding that a Hoffa backer and former officer of Teamsters Local 743 in Chicago violated election rules by collecting and mailing ballots for other members, according to her spokesman, Jeff O'Mara.\nActing on a protest filed by Carey's campaign last week, O'Mara said Quindel decided it would be too extreme a remedy to void all of the local's ballots.\nThe ballots from Local 743 were among the 41,002 ballots that were being checked for eligibility.\nThe election officer has not disclosed interim results of the tabulation of those ballots and O'Mara said he did not know when the final tally would be completed.\nBut Hoffa said Thursday that initial tabulations of the so-called challenged ballots have cut Carey's lead by as much as 2,400 votes.\nThe Carey campaign, however, said the lead was cut only by about 1,500 votes. The latest count which included the strongly pro-Hoffa Local 743, showed Carey with 230,111 and Hoffa with 214,906 with about 30,000 of the challenged ballots remaining to be processed and counted if found to be eligible, the Carey campaign said.",

        "Text": "Chrysler Corp. Monday said sales rose a scant 1.4 percent in November, a dramatic slowdown for the nation's third-largest automaker and a sign of what analysts said would be a weak month for Detroit's Big Three.\nNovember sales of 179,628, up from 177,073 in November 1995, set a record for the month, and Chrysler's year-to-date sales of 2,271,022 surpassed its previous full-year record of 2,208,057 set in 1988. But the 1.4 percent increase was one of the smallest for Chrysler so far this year.\nChrysler said car sales fell 11 percent based on daily selling rates last month while sales of pickup trucks, sport/utility vehicles and minivans rose 7 percent.\nChrysler credited a strong performance from its Dodge and Jeep divisions. Dodge sales were 95,022 and Jeep sales reached 42,835, both records for November.\n\"Our new 1997 lineup continues to generate healthy traffic at our dealerships,\" James Holden, executive vice president of sales and marketing, said in a statement.\nBut Burnham Securities Inc. analyst David Healy said sales to fleet dealers such as car rental agencies fell in November, contributing to the weak performance.\nBoth General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are expected to post lower car sales for November, leading to weak overall sales for the No. 1 and No. 2 automakers.\nThat is expected to drag down the industry's sales by 2 percent to 3 percent, according to Michael Luckey, president of Luckey Consulting Group.\n\"The car market from what I'm hearing is going to be lousy for just about everybody,\" he said.\nLuckey said annual sales based on November's expected performance and government seasonal data would be 14.7 million to 14.8 million units. The rate for October was 14.9 million, and the rate for November 1995 was 14.8 million.\nBut the actual november sales rate could be 300,000 units below that, he said, because of fluctuations in government data used to compute the rate.\nAnalysts noted that slower sales were expected for the second half of 1996, but Healy said it was too early to declare a recession for car sales because monthly sales rates can be volatile.\nGM, set to report sales on Tuesday, is seen posting a 15 percent drop in overall sales, with car sales down more than 20 percent and light truck sales unchanged.\nCar sales were hurt by the three-week Canadian autoworkers' strike in October, which caused a production loss of some 100,000 GM cars. Contributing to the weak numbers were customers who chose to wait for GM's 15 new models instead of buying older versions.\n\"Certainly for quite awhile their car sales are going to be hurt by these painfully slow transitions to the new models,\" said Luckey, noting it could be next spring before GM has full availability of its new cars.\nHealy estimated Ford sales will slide 4 percent to 5 percent. Sales of pickups, minivans and sport/utilities are expected to rise 2 percent, with car sales off 12 percent, he said. Ford is scheduled to announce its sales on Wednesday.\nSubaru of America Inc. reported a 21 percent jump in sales to 11,072 from the previous month. Year-to-date sales from Subaru, a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd of Japan, were 108,533, also up 21 percent from a year ago.\nVolvo AB said U.S. sales fell 3.6 percent to 6,582 for November.",

Battenberg, president General Motors Corp's Delphi Automotive Systems, and Robert Oswald, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Robert Bosch Corp's U.S. automotive unit.\nAsked how much a supplier should expect to pay workers, Leuliette said the global hourly rate for labor-intensive assemblies such as wiring harnesses is $1 to $2. More technical products are made for $10 to $12 an hour.\n\"If you are regionally competitive but not globally competitive, you will unlikely be a supplier to ITT,\" he said.\nBattenberg had three areas of advice for suppliers: focus on a few product areas; continuously stress quality; and pursue international alliances with other suppliers to expand more efficiently.\n\"I just don't think you can be all thing to all people. It's a lesson we learned at General Motors the hard way,\" Battenberg said.\nOswald said suppliers need to be more than good product innovators. \"At Bosch, we believe that our performance as a supplier is not based just on innovation, but also that weare meticulous in bringing that innovation to production,\" he said.\nMeantime, Leuliette said in 2000 suppliers to ITT can expect to receive 80 percent of what they are paid now for their products.\nHe noted the supplier industry is under such pressure to reduce costs that firms need between eight percent and nine percent productivity growth in order to keep their present level of employees.",

        "Text": "Ford Motor Co. said Tuesday it will move 2,500 sales, marketing and customer service workers out of the Renaissance Centre over the next two years, ending a downtown Detroit office presence that dates back to 1978.\nThe move was prompted by General Motors Corp.'s May purchase of the landmark complex located on the Detroit River for use as its new headquarters.\nIncluded in the deal announced Tuesday were 26 acres of land next to the centre now used for employee parking that Ford agreed to sell to GM.\nNo financial terms were released. Robert Rewey, Ford's group vice president of marketing and sales, said at a press conference both sides were \"happy\" with the deal, which has been completed.\nRewey said Ford, which occupies about 650,000 square feet in two of the center's four towers, had planned to stay in its location through 2005 when its leases expire.\n\"Our plans got changed -- by the new landlord,\" he said.\nMost of the employees, who work in the Ford, Lincoln-Mercury and Customer Service Divisions, will be relocated to Ford's existing Regent Court building near the automaker's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich.\nRewey said Ford was not pressured by GM to leave early, but decided to do so because it now has space to relocate workers as a result of its ongoing Ford 2000 reorganization.\nRewey declined to say if GM will pay any of Ford's relocation costs. Those expenses could be substantial because Ford's customer assistance and business assistance centres are computer-intensive, technically sophisticated operations.\nEmployees will begin moving by mid-1997 and should be out of the Renaissance Centre by the end of 1998.\nFearing his urban revitalisation efforts could be hurt, Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer had encouraged Ford to stay in downtown Detroit. But Rewey said Ford could not find a suitable downtown location that would allow it to replicate the efficiencies it now enjoys at the Renaissance Centre.\nHe noted Ford is encouraging its outside advertising agencies and accounting suppliers to remain in Detroit.\nFord officials took pains Tuesday to point out the company remains committed to the resurgence of Detroit. Included in that is a $25 million renovation of the former Veterans Memorial Building late next summer that will serve as the new UAW-Ford Training Centre.\nIn October, Ford agreed to pay $40 million for naming rights to a new downtown stadium for the Detroit Lions professional football team.\nBut some local real estate observers said Ford's decision to leave Detroit does not bode well for the city, which is losing a long-time and prominent tenant. Even though GM will fill the space Ford is vacating, there is still a surplus of class A office space, said Joel Feldman, a broker and market analyst at Friedman Real Estate Group Inc. in Farmington Hills, Mich.\n\"It lessens the possibility that current vacant class A space will be able to fill up, and the spill-over effect on class B office space is diminished because of this,\" he said.\nFord's history with the Renaissance Centre dates back to 1972 when then Chairman Henry Ford II announced the Renaissance Centre development project, which was designed to attract business and employment that would lead to the revitalisation of downtown Detroit.\nFord said its 35,000-square-foot World of Ford exhibition and display area at Renaissance Centre will be discontinued in June 1997. Company officials said they are not sure where or how the exhibit, which is popular with marketing and sales workers, will be reconstructed.",

Trotman reaches the mandatory retirement age of 65 in July of 1998, but the board can ask him to stay on.\nComplicating matters is the prospect of a Ford family member returning to a top officer's role for the first time since 1980.\nRecent reports have said William Clay Ford Jr., 39, a great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford, could be named a non-executive chairman, or chairman, when Trotman leaves.\nBecause Hagenlocker's nearly three-year tenure at Ford Automotive Operations has been marred by slumping profits and a slow start for the redesigned Taurus, some outsiders have said his chances for higher office have dimmed.\nBut Hagenlocker, a reserved man who joined the company in 1964 as a research scientist, has also overseen the launch of the hugely successful new F-Serieswell as the new Ford Expedition full-size sport utility, which is expected to be both popular and profitable.\nEugene Jennings, a retired professor of management at Michigan State University, said Hagenlocker's being put in charge of the new parts organisation could turn into a high-profile spot that should not btion.\n\"It's the one thing that Hagenlocker needs under his belt to give him the experience he needs to run the company,\" said Jennings, a long-time Big Three observer.\nNasser has been at Ford nearly as long as Hagenlocker. Born in Lebanon but raised in Australia, Nasser first joined the company in 1968 as a financial analyst. He rose through several international assignments, earning a reputation as a \"no-nonsense petrol head.\"\nWhile Hagenlocker is stiff in front of the media, Nasser moves easily among reporters, entertaining them with colourful stories about cricket and his globe-trotting life abroad.\nWesley Brown, of industry consultant CSM Forecasting in Farmingtills, Mich., said Nasser's new role also offers him a chance to further demonstrate his abilities at running the company.\n\"It clearly puts Nasser in a position to take over from Trotman when he retires,\" said Brown.\nFor his part, Trotman was circumspect about the succession question. At a news briefing Thursday, he was asked if the board is actively working on the issue.",

CMS, the parent company for Consumers Power Co, Michigan's largest utility, earned $2.27 a share on total revenues of $3.9 billion in 1995.  \nEarlier Friday, CMS announced the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) approved a settlement that removes the final rate uncertainty of its Midland Cogeneration Venture L.P., ending a 10-year regulatory saga involving the embattled plant.\nThe settlement allows Consumers Power to include the cost of buying the final 325 megawatts of power from the plant in its customer rates. Previously, CMS was granted permission to include in rates the cost of buying 915 megawatts of the plant's total 1240 megawatts of power.  \n\"The last significant uncertainty related to the whole Midland situation was the recovery of the remaining 325 megawatts,\" said McCormick, who added he has been dealing with the Midland project since he became CEO of CMS 11 years ago.\nMcCormick said the settlement removes the possibility of future earnings write-downs related to the project. CMS recorded an after-tax charge of $343 million in the fourth quarter of 1992 from an earlier settlement of Midland Cogeneration issues.  \nCMS' stock was up $1 to $32-3/8. Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 206,700, indicating trading for Friday would be more than 300,000 shares, heavier than normal, said McCormick.\nCMS' construction of the facility as a nuclear power plant was abandoned in the mid-1980s. CMS finished its conversion to a gas-powered energy plant in 1990.\nMidland Cogeneration, the largest cogeneration project in North and South America, is a partnership of CMS; Dow Chemical Co, Coastal Corp, Asea Brown Boveri Inc and Fluor Corp.\nApproval of the settlement prompted Standard & Poor's to revise its outlook on Consumers Power and CMS to positive from stable, and re-affirm its ratings on the companies.\nMcCormick said he believes CMS will be meeting with the debt rating agency to discuss a possible upgrade of its ratings.",

Haworth sued Steelcase in November 1985, alleging Steelcase infringed on its patents for pre-wired modular panel systems, which are used to build office cubicles.\nDeveloped during the early 1970s, the technology provides a safe way for electricity to be routed through office panels, eliminating the need for extension cords and helping satisfy the growing demand for electronic office equipment, Haworth said.\nThe decision and damage award, which are binding and cannot be appealed, were entered Dec. 23 by a special judge appointed to determine damages in U.S. District Court in Kalamazoo, Mich.\nIn related rulings, the court denied Steelcase's allegations in a 1989 suit that Haworth infringed on two patents for prewired panels. It also upheld Haworth's position on a lawsuit it filed relating to computer keyboard shelves.\nSteelcase won the first round of the original 1985 lawsuit when a federal court found Steelcase did not infringe Haworth's patent. Haworth appealed that decision and the U.S. Court of Appeals reversed the lower court ruling in 1989.\nThe case then went to a second trial that was an alternative dispute resolution before the special judge in Washington. That trial determined damages and resolved Steelcase's 1989 patent lawsuit against Haworth.\nIn a news release, Haworth said the award provides vindication for its role in developing the first safe method of routing electricity through movable office panels.\n\"But no monetary award can make things right,\" said President Jerry Johanneson. \"No montary award can erase the gains our competitors made when they infringed our patents and used the technology that was rightfully ours.\"\nIn addition to Steelcase, eight other companies have paid more than $75 million to settle patent infringement cases brought by Haworth, it said.\nBased in Grand Rapids, Mich., with a total of 19,000 workers worldwide, Steelcase had total revenues of $2.6 billion for its 1996 fiscal year, which ended in February.\nHaworth, based in Holland, Mich., with more than 9,000 employees around the world, had 1995 sales of about $1.2 billion.",

The agency has received a total of 477 complaints. The probe, first launched in May and upgraded on Oct. 31, covers almost 1.3 million minivans.\nNHTSA also upgraded a preliminary investigation into about 582,000 1996-model Caravan, Voyager and Town & Country minivans. It has received 19 complaints that the right or left sliding door can come open while the vehicle is moving.\nOwners have reported doors opening a few inches or flying wide open at speeds from 15 to 60 mph. No injuries have been reported. NHTSA said it is not aware of any incidents involving vehicles built during or after January 1996.\nChrysler was the first automaker to offer a sliding door on the left side of a minivan. The feature has made the No. 3 automaker's minivans the hottest seller in a popular segment.\nChrysler agreed in 1995, under pressure from regulators, to replace the latches on the rear hatch doors on more than 4 million minivans but stopped short of recalling the vehicles, from the 1984 through 1995 model years. Safety officials said the doors could pop open during low-speed crashes.\nChrysler told the safety agency the sliding door problem may stem from incorrect latch adjustments by dealers, which the company attributed to problems with the service manual.\nChrysler also said eight of the complaints about side doors opening involved vehicles that had had door repairs made. Chrysler said it has corrected the manual procedure and has made three design changes to door components.\nBut NHTSA said it has continued to receive complaints about the doors opening on vehicles with no repair history.\nChrysler spokeswoman Michele Tinson said the automaker was working with the safety agency to resolve the complaints. Injuries reported from sudden closings of rear hatch doors have been minor, she said, noting Chrysler stood behind the safety record of its vehicles.\n\"Minivans are the safest vehicles on the road today,\" she said.\nSeparately, NHTSA said it upgraded an investigation into 621,000 1995 and 1996 Windstar minivans from Ford Motor Co. Regulators have received 327 complaints about brake problems, which have led to 76 accidents and two injuries.\nIn addition to the incidents reported to NHTSA, Ford said it has received 64,000 warranty claims that could relate to a brake problem causing long stopping distances.\nAlso, NHTSA said it opened an investigation into Land Rover's Discovery sport/utility vehicle. It has received two complaints that the right front door opened on 1996 models.

He attributes the decline largely to the continued aftershocks of GM's labour strife this fall, which cost the automaker about 120,000 units of mostly car production.\n\"They're still being hurt by the strikes,\" he said. \"I think that's still a legitimate reason for one more month here in December.\"\nGM is scheduled to report its sales on Friday, Jan. 3.\nFord Motor Co., scheduled to release its results Jan. 6, will enjoy one of its best year-to-year comparisons since March 1994, said Luckey, with sales rising between 8 percent and 9 percent against a somewhat weak performance in December 1995.\nRobert Rewey, Ford group vice president of sales and marketing, said at the Los Angeles International Auto Show that he expected December car sales to be flat with the year-ago level, but truck sales were \"fantastic\" and should be up sharply.\nLast week, Ford added another $500 to the $500 rebate it was already offering on the 1997 Taurus, indicating its determination to hang on the title of the best-selling car in America. Taurus sales through November were about 10,000 units over the rival Honda Accord.\n\"If Taurus sales spurt up, cars might be a little bit better than that,\" said Luckey.\nFord's light truck sales are seen rising a sharp 20 percent, Luckey said, thanks to the strength of its pickup trucks and popular Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle.\nImports and transplants continued to take market share from the Big Three in December, Healy said, climbing to a combined share of 28.6 percent, up from 28.1 percent in November.\n\"The strong dollar and the weak yen are resulting in aggressive pricing by the Japanese makers, particuarly in intermediate and small passenger cars,\" he said.\nFor December, the light vehicle seasonally adjusted annual sales rate is expected to be in the mid-14 million range, analysts said, a precipitous drop from 15.9 million a year ago, the strongest month of 1995.\nHowever, Luckey said the Commerce Department factors used to compute the rate penalise the total by 800,000 units, meaning the real rate is stronger than it would appear.\nMost analysts expect the industry to finish the year at 15.1 million units.\n\"It should be 15.1 million,\" said Luckey. \"That's almost certain unless something very strange happens in December.\"\nThat total would bring the average for the last three years to an unusually stable 15 million mark. In 1995, total light vehicle sales were 14.7 million, down from 15.1 million for all of 1994.",

        "Text": "Sales of light vehicle in December are expected to be down as much as 6 percent from an unusually strong month a year ago, but analysts say the pace was robust enough for 1996's total to match industry projections of 15.1 million units.\nGeneral Motors Corp. will endure the largest drop of the Big Three, with the daily sales rate off by an estimated 16 percent from December 1995, according to David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities Inc.\nGM's sales of pickup trucks, sport/utility vehicles and minivans -- the light truck category -- will be down significantly, in large part because the automaker is up against a tough comparison from a year ago.\nHowever, car sales will also plunge by as much as 20 percent, estimates Michael Luckey, of Luckey Consulting Group. He attributes the decline largely to the continued aftershocks of GM's labor strife this fall, which cost the automaker about 120,000 units of mostly car production.\n\"They're still being hurt by the strikes,\" he said. \"I think that's still a legitimate reason for one more month here in December.\"\nGM is scheduled to report its sales on Friday, Jan. 3. Also reporting Friday is Chrysler Corp., whose sales will be flat or up slightly from December a year ago.\nLight truck sales, which have been accounting for about 70 percent of Chrysler's total, are projected to rise 8 percent, offsetting an expected 9 percent slide in passenger car sales, said Healy.\nFord Motor Co., scheduled to release its results Jan. 6, will enjoy one of its best year-to-year comparisons since March 1994, said Luckey, with sales rising between 8 percent and 9 percent against a somewhat weak performance in December 1995.\nFord's car sales are forecast to dip 3 percent to 4 percent. Last week, Ford added another $500 to the $500 rebate it was already offering on the 1997 Taurus, indicating its determination to hang on the title of the best-selling car in America. Taurus sales through November were about 10,000 units over the rival Honda Accord.\n\"If Taurus sales spurt up, cars might be a little bit better than that,\" said Luckey.\nFord's light truck sales are seen rising a sharp 20 percent, he said, thanks to the strength of its pickup trucks and popular Expedition full-size sport/utility.\nImports and transplants continued to take market share from the Big Three in December, Healy said, climbing to a combined share of 28.6 percent, up from 28.1 percent in November.\n\"The strong dollar and the weak yen are resulting in aggressive pricing by the Japanese makers, particuarly in intermediate and small passenger cars,\" he said.\nFor December 1996, the light vehicle seasonally adjusted annual sales rate is expected to be in the mid-14 million range, analysts said, a precipitous drop from 15.9 million a year ago, the strongest month of 1995.\nHowever, Luckey said the U.S. Commerce Department factors used to compute the rate penalize the total by 800,000 units, meaning the real rate is stronger than it would appear.\nMost analysts expect the industry to finish the year at 15.1 million units.\n\"It should be 15.1 million,\" said Luckey. \"That's almost certain unless something very strange happens in December.\"\nThat total would bring the average for the last three years to an unusually stable 15 million mark. In 1995, total light vehicle sales were 14.7 million, down from 15.1 million for all of 1994.",

        "Text": "Chrysler Corp. Tuesday reported brisk sales of minivans and pickup trucks for August, pushing total U.S. sales for the automaker up 9 percent on a daily selling basis to 186,306.\nThe August total broke a company record for the month of 176,184 set in 1989.\nSales of light trucks, including popular Ram pickups and four-door minivans were 127,870, a 16.7 percent jump that marked the 11th consecutive month of rising light truck sales.\nDomestically produced car sales came in weaker than some analysts had expected, falling 2 percent to 58,255 units.\nChrysler's strong light truck sales were helped by incentives on some Jeep sport utility models. Grand Cherokee sales rose 42 percent; Cherokee was up 52 percent; and Wrangler sales shot up 59 percent.\nTotal pickup sales were held back somewhat by low supplies of the Dakota, which is undergoing a model changeover. Dealers have a 35-day supply of the compact pickups -- about half of what the industry considers to be ideal.\nChrysler executives said they did not expect significant volumes of the new Dakotas to be available until October.\nSteven Torok, executive director of sales and marketing operations, said Chrysler was not concerned about the slide in car sales. Total car sales were down 4 percent from August 1995, and off 24 percent from July.\nAugust is often a seasonally weaker month than July, Torok said. Also, declines in the Dodge Stratus and Neon were partly attributable to model-year changeovers.\n\"Frankly, we saw our cars starting to firm up as the month went on, and we think we'll have a pretty good month in September,\" said Torok, adding September car sales will likely surpass those of August.\nTorok said the No. 3 automaker was pleased with the breadth of its sales performance.\n\"What we see is a very even, consistent demand pattern,\" he said. \"Consumer sentiment seems to be not euphoric but consistent.\"\nAlthough car sales were slightly weaker, PaineWebber analyst Michael Ward said Chrysler's total numbers were still respectable because it was up against a strong year-ago performance.\nChrysler was the only one of the major automakers to report monthly sales on Tuesday. General Motors Corp. is scheduled to repoort sales Wednesday. Ward predicted it will post sales that are 4 percent to 5 percent below last year, with light trucks again offsetting weak car numbers.\nAlso on Tuesday, Subaru of America, a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries, reported U.S. sales up 18 percent to 10,361. Volvo Cars of North America, a unit of AB Volvo had August sales of 7,349, down almost 1 percent.",

        "Text": "General Motors Corp, battling to avoid a second strike by assembly and parts workers this month, said it was hopeful a new labor contract could be reached before an extension deadline at midnight on Sunday.\nSpeaking to reporters gathered at GM's headquarters here, GM spokesman Chuck Licari said GM and the United Auto Workers were still working to resolve difficult and complex issues.\n\"GM remains hopeful an agreement can be reached before the UAW's termination of the current 1993 national agreement at 11:59 p.m. (0459 GMT) tonight,\" said Licari.\nAt stake is a new labor agreement for GM's 215,000 hourly UAW workers. GM employs more than half of the approximately 390,000 UAW members who work at Detroit's Big Three automakers. It is the only one of the Big Three to not have a new three-year labor contract.\nUAW spokesman Frank Joyce declined to comment on the talks. UAW President Stephen Yokich said on Friday that he was not optimistic a deal could be reached by the deadline. In a sign an agreement might not be reached tonight, Licari said GM Chairman Jack Smith was not at the automaker's headquarters, although he was in touch with negotiators.\nBoth Ford Motor Co Chairman Alex Trotman and Chrysler Corp Chairman Robert Eaton were present for the final stages of their company's negotiations and appeared at press conferences announcing a deal.\nBargainers for UAW and GM resumed Sunday morning after they adjourned Saturday evening. Analysts speculated that negotiators could be wrangling over contract language that would dictate how many workers GM would have to guarantee jobs.\nBowing to UAW concerns over job security, both Ford and Chrysler have agreed to new contracts that promise to keep 95 percent of their current UAW hourly workforces except in the event of a severe industry downturn.\n\"I think if there's a sticking point that may be it,\" said Dale Brickner, a labor expert at the Michigan State University. \"GM may be pushing to get that figure farther down than the UAW may be comfortable living with.\"\nGM, the least efficient U.S. automaker, is trying to shed 12 unprofitable parts plants, and wants to exclude certain component facilities from the employment guarantee, including a door hardware plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich.\nIn settling a 20-day strike by the Canadian Auto Workers union last week, GM was able to secure a deal that included the sale of two parts plants and flexibility to outsource more products.\nYokich has not said what he will do after once the contract extension expires at midnight Sunday. He set the deadline on Friday, but did not actually threaten a strike. Workers have been told to stay on the job until they hear otherwise.\nHowever, there was speculation Sunday the UAW could mount a plant-specific strike if not enough progress had been made by the deadline. By hitting light truck plants such as the sport/utility facility in Janesville, Wis., the union could hurt the sale of some of GM's most profitable products at a time it is trying to bounce back from the Canadian strike.\nGM's U.S. operations continue to respond to the strike by 26,000 CAW workers. The more than 6,600 UAW members at GM's Buick City complex have been told not to report Monday. At the same time, GM is running radio ads telling first-shift workers at its Hamtramck assembly plant to report to work Monday.",

        "Text": "Chrysler Corp. said Monday it was exploring the possibilty of extending its car production agreement with Mitsubishi Motors Corp., reversing a trend toward cutting ties with the Japanese automaker.\n\"We are discussing the possibility with them, but we haven't reached any conclusions or any decisions yet,\" said Chrysler spokeswoman Shawn Williams.\nMitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America Inc., the company's U.S. subsidiary, currently builds the Dodge Avenger, Chrysler Sebring and Eagle Talon coupes at its assembly plant in Normal, Ill.\nThat agreement is set to expire after the 1999 model year. Chrysler executives have suggested in the past they want to phase out the automaker's production arrangement with Mitsubishi.\nRichard Recchia, chief operating officer of Mitsubishi's U.S. unit, said in October 1995 the future relationship between the two companies would likely be based more on a partnership of components and engineering exchanges instead of complete products.\nThat is apparently changing.\nAutomotive News, a weekly trade publication, reported Monday that Chrysler Executive Vice President Thomas Gale took a team of executives to Tokyo in November to meet with Mitsubishi officials about extending the current contract through 2004.\nWilliams would not comment on the meeting. Gail O'Brien, a spokeswoman for Mitsubishi's Normal plant, said discussions with Chrysler have been continuing, with Mitsubishi considering numerous options.\n\"Talks have been ongoing, which is totally understandable based on the fact that the contract is coming up,\" she said. Analysts said it would make sense for Chrysler to continue to use Mitsubishi as a production partner.\nSince coupe sales have fallen off in recent years, Chrysler could use its own manufacturing resources to build products where it has a greater competitive edge, such as sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, said Michael Robinet, managing director of CSM Forecasting, an industry consultant in Farmington Hills, Mich.\n\"This way they can steer development dollars to some of their other platforms,\" he said.\nMoreover, if Chrysler were to move Avenger and Sebring coupe production out of the Normal plant, it would most likely have to convert its plant in Toluca, Mexico, which currently builds the popular Sebring convertible, Neon, Cirrus and Stratus cars, analysts have said.\nRobinet also noted that Mitsubishi would benfit from keeping Chrysler as a production customer. Although the Normal plant has capacity to make at least 240,000 vehicles a year, this year it is only expected to make 184,000 units, he said. Next year, the plant is forecast to produce 175,000 units.\nIn addition to the Avenger, Sebring and Talon, the plant makes the Galant sedan and Eclipse coupes for Mitsubishi.\nAccording to Automotive News, Chrysler's products have accounted for 45 percent of the 177,707 units produced through November.\nChrysler was a 50-50 partner with Mitsubishi when the Normal plant, originally called Diamond Star Motors, was founded in 1985. In 1993, Chrysler sold its ownership stake back to Mitsubishi.\nLast year, Chrysler said it would drop the Dodge Stealth sports car from its 1996 model year line up because of slumping sales. Mitsubishi made the Stealth and imported it from Japan. The two companies continue to supply each other with engines.",

        "Text": "With Chairman Jack Smith behind the wheel of a shiny red EV1, General Motors Corp. rolled its first electric vehicle out of the plant Thursday, marking what it dubbed the start of a new era in the auto industry.\nThe car was loaded on the back of an auto-hauling truck at the Lansing Craft Centre that will take it on the first leg of its journey to the West Coast. The cars will go on sale Dec. 5 at 26 Saturn dealerships in Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz.\n\"When they look back on the next 100 years of the evolution of the automobile, they will agree that this car was the first in a new generation of vehicles that redefined the limits of technology and efficiency,\" Smith said during the drive-away ceremony.\nGM spent $350 million and more than six years to develop the two-passenger, sleek-looking coupe. The car is the first and only GM vehicle to carry a GM badge, instead of a name from one of its other seven divisions.\nWhile other automakers have developed and are selling electrically powered vehicles, GM says the EV1 is the first vehicle to be designed from the ground up as an electric car.\nIn his remarks, Smith called the EV1 \"the most technologically advanced vehicle platform in the world,\" incorporating 23 new patents.\nThe EV1 is powered by 26 12-volt lead-acid batteries. It can travel up to 90 miles before it needs recharging. The fully equipped EV1 comes with standard features, including air conditioning, dual air bags, anti-lock brakes, power windows and door locks. It can go from 0 to 60 mph in less than nine seconds, and has a top speed of 80 mph.\nGM announced in October that it will sell the EV1 through a 36-month lease at a sticker price of $33,995. Buyers who receive a $5,000 credit from the state of California will be able to lease an EV1 for $480 a month. Monthly payments without the credit would be $640. The cost does not include a wall-mounted charger, which sells for about $2,000.\nProduction of the EV1 began at the Lansing Craft Centre in August. GM officials will not discuss how many EV1s they intend to sell or produce annually, although the Lansing facility has the capacity to make about 2,000 of the vehicles annually.\nSo far, Saturn has received more than 1,000 calls from potential buyers on a toll-free line, said Joe Kennedy, vice president of sales and marketing for the division. Of that, Saturn estimates about 250 are \"serious\" buyers.\nTalking to reporters after the ceremony, Smith said GM viewed the electric vehicle market as a long-term programme. He again would not say when the EV1 will turn a profit for GM.\n\"Our effort is to make the programme over time to be a business,\" he said. \"The niche is small to start, but it will grow.\"\nKennedy said the initial focus is not on volume but on generating a positive shopping, buying and ownership experience. He said the company will remain flexible in its production and sales plans to adjust to demand.\n\"This is a totally new market, and we don't know what the demand will be on any given month of year,\" he said, noting that Saturn has 13 EV1 specialists who have completed two months of special sales training.",

        "Text": "General Motors Corp., facing a rancorous strike by its Canadian workers, Tuesday reported a $1.3 billion third-quarter profit that was boosted by strong automotive results and an unsually low income tax rate.\nThe world's largest automaker said the combined net income of its North American Automotive Operations and its Delphi Automotive Systems parts businesses was $515 million. A year ago, the operations had a combined loss of $93 million, while the parent company posted a profit of $396.7 million.\nIncreased volume and favourable currency exchange rates helped GM to nearly triple its international operations profits to $323 million from $111 million a year ago.\n\"The third quarter results from continuing operations clearly show momentum as we continue to rebuild our strength in North America and grow our business in key international markets throughout the world,\" GM Chairman John Smith said in a statement.\nThe earnings, equal to $1.57 a share, compared with a profit of 39 cents a share from continuing operations. They do not include results from Electronic Data Systems Corp, which GM spun off in June. Revenues climbed to $39.1 billion from $35.3 billion in the 1995 period.\nContributing to profits was $565 million in one-time favourable items. GM recorded a $253 million after-tax gain from a reduction in the reserve to pay for plant closings, thanks to its decision to use its Wilmington, Del., facility to assemble new Saturn vehicles.\nAlso, GM's effective income tax rate was 2.8 percent, adding another $312 million, as the company took advantage of several tax credits, including a reinstatement of research and experimentation credits for the last half of 1996.\nGM Chief Financial Officer Michael Losh told reporters during a conference call that rate is expected to return to the 27 percent range in the fourth quarter.\nAs it has all year, GM continued to add to its growing cash account in the third period, contributing another $1.5 billion to bring its total cash balance to $14.5 billion at the end of the quarter.\nBecause GM has previously set its cash goal at $13 billion, Ronald Glantz, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, believes the GM board will return some of that money to shareholders.\n\"I thought it was a pretty decent quarter,\" he said. \"I have a lot more confidence that they are going to raise the dividend and announce a share repurchase programme.\"\nGlantz said the annual dividend could go to $2.00 a share from the current rate of $1.60 at the next board meeting Nov. 4. By the end of 1997, he said GM may have in place a $3 billion share repurchase programme.\nGM's third quarter net profit margin from continuing operations rose to 3.7 percent from 1.3 percent. Smith said that was good news, but noted the company still has a ways to go before it reaches its average annual profit margin goal of 5 percent over an auto business cycle.\n\"We still have our work cut out to improve margin performance,\" he said.\nGM delivered more vehicles worldwide in the third quarter -- 2,085,000 vs. 2,060,000 -- but its global market share slipped to 16.1 percent from 16.9 percent.\nThe company also lost share in the U.S. car and truck market, finishing the quarter with 30.4 percent compared with 32.2 percent. GM delivered 1,182,000 vehicles in the United States during the quarter, down from 1,235,000.\nBut CFO Losh said the overall volume increase represented good news for the company, and was a sign there is demand for the bevy of new models it is launching.\n\"It's volume that drives earnings, not market share, per say,\" he said.\nAnother positive sign was the pace of new-model launches, said Losh. Production of full-size vans at Wentzvile, Mo., and Saturn coupes in Spring Hill, Tenn., have reached full line speed, and other plants are on schedule.\nGM is in the midst of launching 15 new cars and trucks. In the third quarter, the company had nine plants actively involved in changeovers. Losh said that is the most it expects to have in a given quarter, adding GM will have seven in changeovers in the fourth quarter.\nHowever, one of those nine plants is a facility in Oshawa, Ontario, which is the target of a strike by Canadian Auto Workers. Losh declined to say how much the strike will set back the new model launch there.\nLosh also declined to comment on status of talks between both the CAW and United Auto Workers. About 26,000 CAW members began walking off the job Oct. 3 over the issue of outsourcing -- the use of outside contractors. GM also has yet to reach a new labour pact with the UAW.\nOn Tuesday, the number of U.S. workers idled by the strike rose to 10,297 from 5,911 on Monday.",

The pact also covers areas Ford may want a dealership where it does not currently have one.\nThe move could have implications for the future of Ohio-based Mullinax Management, one of the largest dealer groups in the country, which is reported to be in merger talks with AutoNation.\nFord spokesman John Ochs said Ford has not sold any dealerships to AutoNation. A spokesman for Mullinax, based in Amherst, Ohio, could not be reached for comment.\nMullinax, which owns several large Ford dealerships, was the 11th largest dealer group in the country, based on its 1995 retail unit sales of 20,374 cars and trucks, according to industry trade publication Automotive News.\nLast month, published reports began to surface on talks between Mullinax and AutoNation. The growing auto superstore chain was founded by Wayne Huizenga, who transformed Blockbuster Video into a multibillion-dollar business and owns the Miami Dolphins professional football team.\nFord's deal with Republic is a \"framework agreement\" that opens the door for AutoNation to submit individual proposals, Ochs said. In a statement, Robert Rewey, Ford's group vice president of marketing and sales, said the automaker believed private entrepreneurs with local community ties will continue to be the \"backbone\" of its franchise system.\n\"However, there will continue to be developments in the industry relating to other types of dealership ownership and distribution methods,\" he said. \"We are working diligently to ensure that the new operators fit into our franchise system.\"\nThat is a change from last February, when Ford Chairman Alex Trotman told the National Automotible Dealers Association it had no plans to offer a new-car franchise to an auto superstore.\nA year ago, Chrysler Corp. announced it would grant a new-car franchise to CarMax Auto Superstore in Norcross, Ga. CarMax is owned by consumer electronics giant Circuit City Stores Inc..\nThe move sent a shockwave through the traditional auto dealer industry, which had already been warily watching the growth of chains such as CarMax and AutoNation in the used-car segment of the business.\nThe new superstores quickly have become popular with consumers because they offer large numbers of newer used cars at haggle-free prices in a pressure-free environment.\nThe Ford announcement signals the superstores will continue to build a presence in the new-car business, analysts said. \"That's big news,\" said William Sawyer, vice president of sales in the Detroit office of Polk, a marketing research firm. \"It's definitely a change for Ford.\"\nThe move is also noteworthy, he said, because Ford has traditionally been opposed to publicly traded companies owning its franchises.\nGeneral Motors Corp. is the last of the Big Three to not have any franchise agreements with an auto superstore. GM spokesman Edward Lechtzin said the automaker was not opposed to the concept and has held talks with those groups in the past.\n\"We've held discussions. We'll continue to hold discussions. If one of them wants to purchase a GM dealership, we'll review it,\" he said.",

        "Text": "Seven years after General Motors Corp created the Geo brand to entice more import buyers, the automaker is dropping the name, though it will continue to sell the Metro, Prizm and Tracker models as Chevrolet vehicles.\nChevrolet General Manager John Middlebrook said the Chevrolet image and its products have improved to the point where it no longer needed the Geo badge to attract new buyers.\nMiddlebrook said the move also fitted in with GM's efforts to unclutter its numerous brand images among consumers.  \nGM created the Geo brand in 1989 as a sub-category of Chevrolet by renaming several Chevrolet vehicles. The name Geo, created under the direction of former GM Chairman Roger Smith, was meant to signify a world car.\nGM plans no changes to the joint venture agreements that produce the Geo vehicles. The Prizm, essentially the same car as the Corolla from Toyota Motor Corp, is made by NUMMI, a Fremont, Calif.-based venture with Toyota.\nBoth the Metro and Tracker are produced in Ingersoll, Ontario, at CAMI, GM's joint venture with Suzuki Motor Corp.  \nMiddlebrook, who took over as general manager of Chevrolet in early 1996, said the move has been under consideration for some time, following the renewed strength of the Chevrolet brand.\nChevrolet, which currently has 16 different products, has introduced 18 new models since 1989. Consumer research has shown that awareness levels and purchase consideration jump between 30 percent and 40 percent when target buyers compare Chevrolet with Geo, the company said.\n\"It's the strength of the Chevrolet brand that's driving this,\" Middlebrook said.  \nIn a sign that GM still has an image problem with import buyers, Prizm sales lag those of its Corolla sister by a wide margin. The Prizm sold about 77,000 units through November of this year, compared with 188,000 for the Corolla.\nSales for all three Geo vehicles have fallen since reaching a high of 325,000 in the 1990 calendar year. Sales for the first 11 months of 1996 totaled 206,491. Although that was an increase of eight percent over a year ago, the vehicles carried rebates ranging from $300 to $1,000.  \nIn selling the Prizm as a Chevrolet, the division's 4,400 U.S. dealers will have a car similar in price and features to the Cavalier sedan.\nHowever, Richard Scheidt, Geo brand manager, said GM did not anticipate too much duplication because traditional Geo buyers are different from typical Chevrolet buyers. For instance, he said the Prizm outsells the Cavalier in Texas.\nAnalysts reacted favorably to the move, saying it demonstrates another step by GM to use its marketing and advertising resources more efficiently.  \nJoseph Phillippi, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, said it was also not out of the question that GM would eventually drop some of the current Geo models.\n\"I would guess at some point in time they would do some additional pruning,\" he said.\nChevrolet, which will gain some marketing efficiencies through the move, will pay for the new signs that dealers will be required to put up, Middlebrook said.\nGerald Seiner, a Chevrolet-Geo dealer in Salt Lake City, Utah, said dealers were in favor of the move because it would bring a simpler image to the Chevrolet brand.  \n\"Frankly, I haven't had anybody walk through the door and say they want to buy a Geo,\" he said.",

He attributes the decline largely to the continued aftershocks of GM's labour strife this fall, which cost the automaker about 120,000 units of mostly car production.\n\"They're still being hurt by the strikes,\" he said. \"I think that's still a legitimate reason for one more month here in December.\"\nGM is scheduled to report its sales on Friday, Jan. 3.

Last week, Ford added another $500 to the $500 rebate it was already offering on the 1997 Taurus, indicating its determination to hang on the title of the best-selling car in America. Taurus sales through November were about 10,000 units over the rival Honda Accord.\n\"If Taurus sales spurt up, cars might be a little bit better than that,\" said Luckey.\nFord's light truck sales are seen rising a sharp 20 percent, he said, thanks to the strength of its pickup trucks and popular Expedition full-size sport/utility.\nImports and transplants continued to take market share from the Big Three in December, Healy said, climbing to a combined share of 28.6 percent, up from 28.1 percent in November.\n\"The strong dollar and the weak yen are resulting in aggressive pricing by the Japanese makers, particuarly in intermediate and small passenger cars,\" he said.\nFor December 1996, the light vehicle seasonally adjusted annual sales rate is expected to be in the mid-14 million range, analysts said, a precipitous drop from 15.9 million a year ago, the strongest month of 1995.\nHowever, Luckey said the U.S. Commerce Department factors used to compute the rate penalise the total by 800,000 units, meaning the real rate is stronger than it would appear.\nMost analysts expect the industry to finish the year at 15.1 million units.\n\"It should be 15.1 million,\" said Luckey. \"That's almost certain unless something very strange happens in December.\"\nThat total would bring the average for the last three years to an unusually stable 15 million mark.

The rate is now about 114, meaning it takes more yen to buy one dollar.\nVan Bussman, Chrysler Corp.'s top economist, believes the yen will continue in the 110-115 range for the first three to six months of 1997, then strengthen to about 100.\n\"I think it will be a substantial issue in 1997,\" Bussman said. \"The yen having weakened from 80 to 110 has given them tremendous profit potential in North America.\"\nA look back through 1996 shows that Japanese automakers have already turned the weaker yen to their advantage through lower prices.\nIndustry trade publication Automotive News reported the average 1997 model year price increase at Detroit's Big Three was $386, while the average price hike for Japanese automakers was a mere $8.\n\"It's going to be tough next year because we have the weaker yen,\" Ford Motor Co. Chairman Alex Trotman said recently.\nForecasts for 1997 project total vehicle sales will be roughly the same as the 15.4 million expected for 1996. But that's not all that bad, industry executives say.\nIt means the four-year upswing of car, sport utilty and pickup truck sales could continue for yet another year.\n\"We see moderate inflation. We see a steady continuation of economic expansion in the United States,\" Trotman said. \"We're looking for the car and truck industry to fall somewhere in the 15 to 15.5 million range for 1997, which we would describe as a pretty good year.\"\nJapanese automakers, which have introduced hot new car and sport utility vehicles this year, are set to unleash more new products in 1997.\nHonda Motor Co. Ltd. will soon introduce its CR-V compact sport utility and is scheduled to bring out new versions of its Accord sedan and Odyssey minivan. Building on the momentum of its new Camry sedan, Toyota Motor Corp. will unveil a front-wheel drive minivan called the Sienna next fall.\nAmong the Big Three, 1996 proved to be the year that Chrysler's raft of stylised new products took off, outshining its two domestic rivals. The No. 3 automaker has boosted U.S. market share nearly two points to 16 percent, and its calendar year sales will post their best results since 1988.\nGeneral Motors Corp. will try to reverse a slide in both sales and market share next year as it continues with the introduction of 15 new cars and light trucks, including a new line of minivans.\nGM will also look to improve its overall competitiveness with a new three-year contract with the United Auto Workers that could allow it to shed 30,000 workers. But that deal did not come cheaply. GM endured several strikes through the year that will cost it more than $1.6 billion.\nAt Ford, cost-cutting will remain a top priority next year. The No. 2 automaker has scored big in the market place with its new F-Series pickup trucks and Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle.\nBut its car sales have lagged, and Ford has been forced to slap incentives on its redesigned Taurus to push them out of dealer showrooms. Ford, which replaced the head of its core automotive operations in October, will also lose hundreds of millions from European and South American operations in 1996, but sees improvements in those areas for 1997.",

        "Text": "China has taken its cue from U.S. Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan and tried to talk its raging stock markets lower but some investors said Beijing regulators did not need to shout.\nChina's official People's Daily ran a front-page commentary on Monday calling on investors to behave rationally in investing in the market, warning that what goes up must come down.\nThe commentary, carried prominently in major financial newspapers as well, also reminded the investing public that the safest place to put its money was in the bank.\nMany Chinese officials and stock market brokers noted similarities to Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan's now famous remarks this month about \"irrational exuberance\" of U.S. markets.\nGreenspan's remarks, which did not specifically mention stocks, were clear enough to send share markets around the globe into a steep, if brief, fall. Since then many investors have remained cautious.\n\"There were definite similarities in approach,\" said a stock market policy official who declined to be identified.\n\"They (regulators) are looking at the same objectives -- the stock markets were too high and they hoped the markets would move lower,\" he said.\nA spokeswoman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission chuckled over the suggestion that Greenspan might have inspired Beijing's action.\n\"Our objective was to bring some stability to the market,\" she said without elaborating.\nWhatever the objective, many brokers and investors were not entirely sympathetic with the result.\n\"The phrasing (of the commentary) was much too tough,\" said an angry broker in Shenzhen, home of one of the nation's two officially approved stock markets.\n\"This was over the top,\" he said.\nThe commentary called up images of Wall Street's 1929 crash while it lashed out at big investors for manipulating the market and blamed brokers for improperly extending overdrafts to finance stock purchases.\nThe state media also came under criticism for helping to pump up the market by urging investors to buy shares.\nLast week, the bourses in Shanghai and Shenzhen in southern China slapped curbs on share movements, limiting them to a daily 10 percent in either direction.\nShenzhen's A share market for domestic investors fell the 10 percent limit on Monday, sliding 46.34 points to 417.2 while Shanghai's A share market lost 9.92 percent, or 115.37 points, to 1,047.68.\nThe B share indices, which track shares supposedly reserved for foreign investors, closely mirrored the A share falls.\nBoth Shenzhen and Shanghai had seen huge run-ups in share prices this year, with most of the gains made in recent months. Shenzhen had surged 360 percent from a trough to the peak this month, while Shanghai had climbed about 150 percent.\nSome brokers were sympathetic to the plight of regulators.\n\"The market was clearly very speculative,\" said a Beijing-based broker. \"I disagree with some people over how far ahead of itself the market actually was but there was bound to be a considerable pyschological impact from any action by the regulators.\"\nBrokers said that part of the reason behind the steep rise was the lack of alternative investments.\nTwo interest rate cuts this year had played a key role in luring money into the stock market.",

        "Text": "Two years ago, China's second telephone network set out to challenge the powerful Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) and bring competition into the country's a fast-growing market.\nBut the fledgling network has found it hard to tackle a seasoned competitor -- one that is also the market regulator.\n\"Are they (the MPT) supposed to be the referee or one of the athletes on the playing field?\" asks Li Huifen, president of China United Telecommunications Corp, also known as Unicom.\nThe arrival of Unicom and the end of the MPT monopoly was initially hailed as a boost for China's long-suffering telephone subscribers, who often had to wait up to a year for a telephone line and endure indifferent service afterwards.\nBut Unicom has captured only a tiny slice of the market as its entrenched competitor has kept a tight grip on the telecommunications sector, using its regulatory clout to slow the upstart network's advance.\n\"They have delayed interconnections and won't give us telephone numbers for our customers,\" Li said in an interview. \"We need a telecommunications law to give us a legal framework.\"\nUnicom has 16 shareholders, but the key backers of the project were the ministries of electronics industry (MEI), power and railways.\nMANUFACTURING MUSCLE\nThe MEI has manufacturing muscle with a corps of factories producing telecommunications equipment. But it feared the MPT's equipment-making capacity would eventually squeeze it out of the market unless it had its own captive customers.\nThe other key partners had private telecommunications networks with spare capacity, while the MPT's public network was heavily overcrowded.\nThe feud between the rival Chinese government camps was often bitter, sometimes ensnaring foreign companies. Firms that did business with the new network were threatened with blacklisting by the MPT, according to Western industry sources.\nThose frictions have eased somewhat in recent months, but it still took an order from the State Council, or cabinet, for promised network interconnections to emerge.\nChina expects to have more than 60 million telephone lines installed by the end of this year -- adding a breathtaking 10 million in 1996 alone. The total is likely to top 100 million by the turn of the century, still only a small segment of the nation's 1.2 billion people.\nMPT says it should not be considered a competitor to Unicom because it has a separate operating arm called China Telecom.\n\"Since 1993, we have separated policy making from business operations by creating China Telecom,\" said an MPT spokesman. \"The MPT is not both regulating and competing,\" he said, blaming Unicom's slow progress on its own technical problems.\nSTRUGGLE TO BE IMPARTIAL\nBut China Telecom officials concede it is hard to say where one entity ends and the other begins. And even if they can draw the line cleanly, the MPT must struggle to remain impartial.\n\"They always say they are being fair,\" said Unicom's Li. \"But China Telecom is their own child, and parents are always partial to their own children.\"\nLi took up the Unicom reins in August, becoming the third president in the company's brief history. She was tapped from her job as deputy mayor of the big industrial city of Tianjin to put political clout behind the second network.\nThe company started with mobile telephone services, first in the big cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou, and eventually expanded to 16 cities. It has made its greatest inroads in Shanghai where it has about 20,000 mobile phone customers, Li said.\n\"In 10 years we will have 10 percent of the fixed line market and 30 percent of the mobile phone market,\" Li said.\nOne clear success has been in bringing mobile telephone prices down. They now cost 7,000 to 10,000 yuan ($840 - $1,200) compared with 10,000 to 20,000 yuan before Unicom came along.\nLi says Unicom is profitable on its operations, but that excludes heavy investments in building network infrastructure. Despite the cost of putting a network in place, Unicom has one advantage. Foreigners are not permitted to operate telecommunications networks in China, and many foreign firms give Unicom capital in return for a share of the income.\nThat will at least ease the growing pains for the infant network, analysts said.",

Many investors say 'you are not big enough',\" he said, adding that more shares would be sold once the assets were injected into the listed vehicle.\nThe plan requires a sharp reduction in the price-to-earnings ratio of the company's stock -- now at about 23 -- to about 10.\nDuan said a sharp rise in earnings expected this year and in 1997 would help to set the stage for the plan.\nThe Beijing-based Stone Group Corp listed shares in 1993 with a HK$300 million ($38 million) flotation for Stone Electronic Technology Ltd.\nThe group still has a controlling 57 percent stake in the Hong Kong company, which makes integrated word processors and printers and distributes a wide range of products, including computers as well as office and lighting equipment.\nStone Group now has 18 joint ventures and it plans to start placing some of those assets into the listed firm.\n\"We are preparing to inject some of the profitable companies into that vehicle,\" Duan said.\nStone Group probably will inject a large part of its 40 percent stake in a $60 million China-based joint venture with Matsushita of Japan to produce light fixtures. The plant has required heavy start-up costs but should be profitable next year, Duan said.\nStone Group also has a stake in a $1.6 billion semiconductor project with Mitsubishi Electric and Mitsui in China, although that will not begin production until late 1997 or early 1998.\nStone, one of the success stories of China's electronics industry, was started with a loan of 20,000 yuan ($2,400) in 1984.\n\"We used to compete with just the little guys,\" said Duan.\n\"That has changed dramatically in recent years,\" he said, adding that all major multi-nationals were now in the domestic market as China has relaxed its once-tight curbs on imports.\n\"Technology is also changing rapidly so we have to make use of our capital,\" the executive said. \"We can't let it stand still.\"\nStone Electronic's profits slumped to HK$17 million in 1995 from HK$63.88 million in 1994. But earnings for the first half of this year were up 44 percent over the year-ago period to HK$10.22 million.\n\"I can't give a profit figure for all of this year but the full year growth will be better than first-half growth,\" Duan said, adding that 1997 should continue that trend.\nStone sees specialised electronic products for the banking system and tax collection as areas where it has major advantages over its competitors.",

But Beijing had to make clear its commitment to full compliance and show progress on granting access to its domestic markets.\nChina's Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi on Thursday appeared to be unconvinced that the United States, which has been a key hurdle to Beijing's drive to join the global trade organisation, was ready to change its stance.\n\"Their intentions are kind-hearted,\" said Wu in a reference to the European effort. \"But the question of China's accession to the World Trade Organisation is not entirely decided by the European Union,\" she told reporters at the same business conference.\nBeijing has been pushing to join the WTO under the more lenient terms of developing nation status but Washington has insisted that China's economy is too big for such treatment.\nBrittan, who is leading a delegation of 30 European business leaders hoping to tap into the Chinese market, said he would meet senior Chinese officials, including Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and foreign trade minister Wu.\nBrittan made it clear that a reaffirmation of Chinese acceptance of the European position would be enough for him to try to take his case to the United States.\n\"The U.S. was erecting very high hurdles to be surmounted,\" he said of the American position.\nBut he said the end of the U.S. presidential election campaign could be an opportunity for making progress in the negotiations.\n\"Recent stirrings in the media...suggest that the U.S. is perhaps readier now than over the past two years to heed European calls for decisive engagement on this negotiation,\" Brittan said.\nBrittan praised China for making strides in strengthening intellectual property rights though he said more market access was needed.\nHe also warned that Europe would not be discriminated against in the Chinese market, and he singled out bilateral shipping agreements as an area of concern.\n\"Europe cannot accept unequal treatment and will not be discriminated against,\" he said.\nOn Wednesday, Chinese leaders denounced Beijing's exclusion from the WTO as unjust, saying the world's largest developing nation had made great strides in opening its markets to trade and investment.\nBeijing also lashed out on Thursday at European Union investigations into Chinese textile exports, hinting at retaliatory measures if the probes led to anti-dumping measures.",

That meant contacts would proceed despite continued disagreements over a range of issues from human rights, to trade and China's political rivalry with Taiwan.\nChinese Minister of Defence Chi Haotian is now in the United States after twice delaying a visit -- both times due to tension over Taiwan.

But for some of them, hosting him in their own country is another matter, diplomats said.\nLi has been tarred with the decision to use military force to crush the pro-democracy protests in Beijing in 1989, though paramount leader Deng Xiaoping was the only man with sufficient clout to order in the army.\nPresident Jiang was also elevated to his role as Communist Party chief because of his tough stance on dissent.\nLi has not visited the United States, the United Kingdom or Australia since 1989. He has travelled to Germany, France and Canada since then, though he has been dogged by controversy on each trip.",

Two of the biggest stakes, worth 90 million yuan ($10.8 million) each, are held by diversified Guangzhou Yitong Group and Xiamen Fuxun Group that has interests from real estate to pharmaceuticals.\nThe bank is relatively small by Chinese standards with total capital of 1.38 billion yuan and assets of 5 billion yuan.\nJing says it may not be profitable in its first year due to start-up costs but it aims for a 50 percent return on shareholder capital by the third year of operation.\nBy then, it hopes to have assets of over 10 billion yuan.\nIt differs from many of China's state-run banks that are unable to recover their loans -- made as policy decisions in support of struggling, government-run enterprises.\n\"We have no policy loans,\" said Jing.\nChina Minsheng has extended over 1.0 billion yuan in loans this year -- all on commercial terms.\n\"Most loans are for working capital and not for more than one year,\" he said. \"All have collateral or a guarantee.\"\nThe bank's headquarters are a short walk from the Beijing city government, but Jing said officials do not stroll over to ask for special favours for hard-hit local companies.\n\"They go to the other banks,\" he said. \"The state banks are trying to become commercial banks but they still have to make some policy loans.\"\nBesides its headquarters and an office for international business, China Minsheng has three branches in Beijing. One is in the Haidian district where many high-technology, non-state companies have sprung up -- just the type of customer it wants.\nThe bank cannot lure deposits with higher interest rates since all deposit rates are fixed by the central bank.\nInstead, it must compete in terms of service, staying open longer hours and pumping funds into improving technology by installing computer and automated teller equipment.\nIt has some flexibility on the interest it charges borrowers, though, with a range of 10 percent above or below levels set by the central bank.\nIn the future, China Minsheng will face more competition from foreign banks -- now barred from taking deposits or making loans in Chinese currency.\n\"At the moment, they cannot do local currency business,\" said Jing. \"But that will change.\"\nThe bank is already looking at new areas of business, such as home mortgages, to meet expected demand as China develops a real estate market.\nIt may also want to tap domestic or foreign capital markets to ensure it has the financial muscle to stay competitive.\n\"There could be a movement in this direction in the future,\" Jing said. \"But first we need a good performance over the next three years.\"\n($1 = 8.3 yuan)",

At his last appearance he looked frail and unsteady.\nThe documentary showed a vigorous leader, larger than life and portrayed against a background of golden clouds radiating across the sky.\nHe was seen inspecting factories while donning a hard hat, shaking hands with children and receiving gifts of poppies in Paris in the 1970s.\nThe main theme of the one-hour show was clearly reform, underlining China's commitment to its course of market-oriented economic change charted by Deng and continued under his chosen successor President Jiang Zemin.\nBut its use of adulatory tones -- opposed by Deng who abhorred the personality cult of revolutionary leader Mao Zedong -- suggested that the ageing party veteran had little or no control over the documentary's contents.\nSpeculation about Deng's health surfaces periodically and an unconfirmed report described him as lapsing briefly into unconsciousness this week.\nSome Hong Kong newspaper reports said he had been admitted to a top military hospital but there were no unusual movements this week at the Beijing medical centre where senior officials are usually treated.\nDeng had vowed to visit Hong Kong to witness the historic transfer of power at midnight on June 30 this year but a Beijing official believed to be close to the Deng family said recently this was unlikely.\nOn Wednesday, the People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, called on China's 1.2 billion people to uphold Deng's credo of pragmatism known as \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\".\nIn an article published earlier this week the newspaper described the television series on the life of the nation's paramount leader as one that \"showed in their entirety the glorious achievements and greatness of the theories of comrade Deng Xiaoping.\"\nThe documentary had taken four years to complete and included interviews with more than 100 senior officials, according to official media.\nPreviews from the series showed Deng giving words of encouragement to party officials and reviewing China's military might -- interspersed with glimpses of sleek skyscrapers and modern factories, symbols of the material progress inspired by the party patriarch.\n\"This is very much linked to the party congress,\" said a Chinese academic. \"It is setting the tone for those taking part in the party congress.\"\nPresident and Communist Party chief Jiang narrated parts of the episode seen on television and was shown giving his assessment that Deng had made an important contribution to the building of a modern, socialist China.\nJiang is widely seen as the man who has the most to gain from the adulation for the paramount leader.\n\"This shows he (Jiang) has the mantle of Deng,\" said another Western diplomat.\n\"He is building up himself by building up Deng.\"",
